This Win Batch file and Python script I made to parse ggamelist.xml file produced by Emulationstation or scraper.exe.

These can then be used on the OG Xbox with my XBMC-Emustation dashboard as synopsis file for roms.


PS:
I know the scrip is crap but it works lol

Note: you need install Python 2.7 onto your PC.


I will update the scrip at a later date to clean it up and do it right. But it works as of right now so.
