_________________________
This compact version of the great and noble game of golf, has the player take control of Tiger himself or other less famous golfers. The player must look out for swing timing and not hook the ball into one of the many bunkers, nor must they underpower the shot or fall short of the fairway. The game of golf is simulated to an accurate level and is both compelling and frustrating, just like the real thing.
