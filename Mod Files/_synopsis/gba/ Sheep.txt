Unbeknownst to most people, sheep are actually aliens that were sent to observe the earth millions of years ago. In the process, the were dumbed down to the sheepish mammals we all know and love today. In this Lemmings-inspired game, your goal is to herd sheep across 28 hazard-filled levels so they can be rescued by their educated alien cousins.
