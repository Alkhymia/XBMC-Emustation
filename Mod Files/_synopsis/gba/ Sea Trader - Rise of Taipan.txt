"Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan" is a unique commodities trading game for the GameBoy Advance. Set against the backdrop of the 1840's Opium Wars between Britain and China, the player must command a trading ship and sail dangerous seaways across the world in order to find, purchase and sell exotic goods for the best price. The prize: a trading empire dominating the globe. The addictive gameplay of "Sea Trader" hearkens back to classic trading games such as "Taipan" and "Dope Wars", but has much improved graphics and is more action-oriented and engaging.
