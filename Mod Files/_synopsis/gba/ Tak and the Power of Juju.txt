Like the console version of this game, Tak and the Power of Juju features the evil shaman Tlaloc, who was prophesied to steal the Moon Stones, and through that attempt to cause the fall of the Moon Juju. Lok the apprentice had been trained to battle the evil shaman when he appeared, but now Lok and the rest of the villagers have been turned into sheep, leaving just Tak behind.

The Gameboy Advance version of Tak and the Power of Juju is a side-scrolling action game. Play through eight worlds, each with multiple levels. Tak starts with a blowgun, and will pick up a club as well during his adventure. To add a bit of variety, there are swimming and flying levels.
