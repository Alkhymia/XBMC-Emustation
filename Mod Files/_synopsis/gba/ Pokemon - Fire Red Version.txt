_________________________
Pok?mon FireRed takes the player into the world of Kanto on a mission to catch all of the 350 pok?mon for Pok?mon researcher Prof. Oak. Pok?mon are animal-looking creatures that pretty much form this and all the other games in the Pok?mon Universe. Your challenge is to capture them all using pok?balls and your own set of these strange creatures, as well as training them for the ultimate battle, the Elite Four!

It is a remake of the original and offers the same diversity of gameplay as the original. However, this game's got everything you might miss in the classic game: updated art, splendid graphics, new pok?mon and perhaps the most interesting: the wireless adapter. This makes you able of wirelessly trading with your friends within a limited radius. In addition to all of this, FireRed lets you explore a new set of islands outside of Kanto, the Sevii Islands! Enter the union room, make the team of your dreams or explore the world of Kanto in this epic gameplay experience from the Universe of Pok?mon. Gotta catch 'em all!
