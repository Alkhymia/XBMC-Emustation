Eggman has broken the world into seven parts, now you must find the seven Chaos Emeralds to restore the world. Sonic Advance 3 is a sonic game with a twist, you can play with a friend in co-op mode or one of many multi-player modes like ring race. Sonic Advance 3 has features of Sonic Advance and Sonic Advance 2 but with more options like choosing from 2 characters in story mode (a leading and a following character).
