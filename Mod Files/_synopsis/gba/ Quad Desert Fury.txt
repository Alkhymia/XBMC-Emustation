Amid intense heat and piercing granules of sand, the only thing you should worry about is being the first one to cross the finish line. Quad Desert Fury drops you in various desert environments, where you can race on a variety of challenging tracks. It's up to you to outwit and outmaneuver three AI-controlled opponents. Keep your foot on the gas, while avoiding sinkholes, dunes, desert wells, land mines, and other hazards.
