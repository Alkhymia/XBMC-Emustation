_________________________
Like the movie of the same name and the console version, LarryBoy and the Bad Apple features Bumblyburg, which is threatened by the super-villain the Bad Apple. She is tempting the town's citizens into sin, and only LarryBoy can stop her.

Gameplay consists of platform-based puzzles. Reach the green ticket in each level, within the time limit. Avoid enemies, run, jump, roll and swing your way around the levels.
