Motocross Maniacs Advance is a side-scrolling racing game with dirt bikes as the main vehicle of choice. There are four modes of play, Race, Time Attack, Action (stunt tracks for points) and Link Battle (which requires four more cartridges and the link cable to use). There are six different riders to choose from, each with their own different attributes and abilities. Players can also pick up power-ups during races such as heat-seeking missiles and land-mines along with the nitro tanks among others.
