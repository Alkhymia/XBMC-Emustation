You're familiar with the Soviet Mind Game that involves stacking tetrominoes, or geometric shapes composed of four square blocks, inside a well. But have you ever played it while high? LOCKJAW: The Overdose simulates what it might be like to play the Soviet Mind Game under the influence of marijuana, LSD, or other hallucinogenic drugs.
