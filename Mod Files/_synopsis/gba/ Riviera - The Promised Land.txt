_________________________
Riviera: The Promised Land is a turn based RPG. It follows a traditional RPG formula (once peaceful land now ravaged by demons and their wars with angels.) however it also incorporates a "dating sim" as a subplot where your character must win affection of another character.

It has similarities to Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, Golden Sun and a number of others. Reaching high levels is important to make the game not too difficult at the end, however the levelling up is similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill for a character increases at a different rate to the character levels.
