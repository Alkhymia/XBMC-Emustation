The fourth US release in the Ogre Battle series, The Knight of Lodis follows Alphonse, a young knight from the Holy Lodis Empire. Sent to the island of Ovis to investigate a series of unusual events, Alphonse begins to question his loyalty and purpose as a knight of Lodis and involving himself in a battle of epic proportions.

Tactics Ogre's gameplay is squad-based and turn-based, just like Final Fantasy Tactics, and despite many RPG elements, the game almost entirely consists of combat. Aside from the main campaign, Tactics Ogre also offers a VS mode and a Quest mode, in which the player must complete objectives they set themselves within a certain number of turns to earn rare items to use in the campaign mode. Finally, there is also an option to exchange characters and items between players with a link cable.
