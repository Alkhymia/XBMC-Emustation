_________________________
The portable addition of Tony Hawk's latest skating craze (American Wasteland) provide an altogether different experience, especially in terms of the visual presentation.

Pushing aside realism, Sk8land goes with a cel-shaded atmosphere, where the same gameplay mechanics of skaing around each park completing objectives and challenges are as addictive as always.

Nintendo DS players will also take Sk8land online through the wi-fi mode, along with touch screen controls. GBA players aren't left behind either, with an updated create-a-park and skater modes and multiplayer to boot.
