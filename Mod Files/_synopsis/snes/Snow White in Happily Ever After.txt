It seems like poor Snow White is always the intended victim in some evil character's plot. And in SNOW WHITE IN HAPPILY EVER AFTER, that's the case once again. This time around, the witch's brother, Maliss, has his sights set on Snow White and the Prince. He's been casting wicked spells throughout the kingdom, and it's up to you to stop him and restore peace and happiness to the Kingdom. Playing as either Snow White or Shadowman, you'll have to make your way through eight levels filled with dangerous enemies and challenging gameplay in order to be successful. Luckily, though, you can change the difficulty level if things get too frustrating, and you can continue your game as long as your fingers can stand it with the continuous play feature. There's only one person who can help SNOW WHITE IN HAPPILY EVER AFTER you!
