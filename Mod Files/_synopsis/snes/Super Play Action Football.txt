Super Play Action Football is an American football video game developed by Nintendo for the Super NES. It is the follow up to NES Play Action Football.

Although not lacking in quality game play, it was commercially unsuccessful as it faced fierce competition from competitors such as Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series

The goal of the game is to obtain the ball and reach the other end of the field to score a touchdown, while avoiding opponent players who can pile onto the character possessing the ball. If the opponent players do manage to pile onto the character holding the ball, the play stops and the team goes back to the previous line. A quirk in the gameplay allows the defensive player to get an easy sack if they dive with the nose tackle at the precise moment the ball is snapped.

Guaranteed Blocked PAT
There is a glitch on the PAT that will allow you to block the kick each and every time your opponent goes for one after the touchdown.

Have your player line up over the center before the snap. When the holder shouts 'Ready, ' press down and the Y button to jump over the line of scrimmage. If you do this correctly, you will be between the center and the holder. Do not touch anyone yet, as you get an off sides penalty.

When the holder shouts 'Set', press the START button, which brings you to the pause screen that shows the score, quarter, etc. Wait for one second and press the START button again. You will still be in between the center and the holder, but the game doesn't acknowledge your presence! This makes the kick easy pickings now. When the ball is snapped, wait for the ball to pass through you and into the holders hands.  You should easily be able to press Y again to jump onto the holder and snuff the kick.
