_________________________
Uncharted Waters is a popular Japanese video game series produced by Koei. In East Asia, the series has a large cult following, but has not received much recognition outside East Asia. The series has been compared to Sid Meier's Pirates! in gameplay and theme. It is a simulation and CRPG series dealing with sailing and trading.

In the games, the player takes up the role of a captain and manages a seagoing fleet to participate in trades, privateering, treasure hunting, exploration, and plain piracy. Even though the series is largely open-ended, there is still a loose plot which requires the player to follow certain paths, and deviating from these paths may stall the progress of the story.

Tips:

Initial Stat Increase
At the start of the game, answer 'No' to the presented stats. Continue doing this for a while until the stats boom upward inexplicably. You need to say 'No' 80 or so times to activate.
