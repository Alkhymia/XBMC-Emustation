_________________________
Known as Daikoukai Jidai II in Japan, this game is perhaps the most famous of the series. Even though an English version exists, it still has not managed to achieve the mainstream popularity Pirates! had. There is only a relatively small following outside of East Asia.

In this game, there are six protagonists to choose from, each of them representing a different path or career featured in the game.  While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot.

Tips:

Almost Never Get Attacked
Enter Black Beard as your name, and no pirates will
attack you.

Easy money
To gain some easy gold at the beginning of the game, take the COLLECT DEBT job at the guild in Venice. When you collect the 5 gold ingots, deposit it in a bank. Then go back to Venice and the banker will say you failed the job. You still get to keep the gold. Do this only when you have no fame or else you will lose some of your fame.

Faster Battles
Hold the button 'Y' when it is not your turn to speed up the battle.
