After being defeated more times than he would like, the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, puts a 10,000 year old plan into effect. Sending Shang Tsung to Earthrealm to resurrect his dead queen, Sindal, the emperor then merges Earthrealm with Outworld to retrieve her. Thousands of people are killed instantly, except for those few souls that Raiden protects to fight to save Earthrealm. Now it is up to these few warriors to save their once beloved planet. Good Luck!

Mortal Kombat 3 is, as you guessed, the third installment of the Mortal Kombat series. The game is as fun as its two predecessors, with the same realistic graphics and heart pumping music. This version, however, was subject to wide-spread criticism due to the fighting stages not being set in a fantasy realm like the last games, and also due to the lack of several of the classic characters such as Scorpion and Kitana. The game, however, is just as entertaining as the last two, and in my opinion features more realistic graphics and better music.

Directions:

Mortal Kombat 3 is the third installment of the famed fighting series. Much like the last two games, this game has the same premise, with warriors from Earthrealm fighting in a tournament to save their planet.

To get started is simple, choose one of the many characters such as Cyrax, Kabal, Nightwolf, Sektor, Sheeva, Stryker, Liu Kang, Kano, Kung Lao, Jax, Shang Tsung, Smoke, Sonja Blade, and Sub-Zero. Then fight your way past the other characters and the two bosses, Motaro and Shao Kahn. After that you'll have beaten the game. Before fighting you can enter the options page and change the difficulty and even give yourself a handicap. That's pretty much the game in a nutshell. So sit down, Log in, and Have fun.
