Just what it sounds like, a new Super Metroid level design hack. Take a look at the readme for more important info. There are some graphical kinks that were compromises with the SM code.

Savestates are recommended, as save points are pretty rare, but then, this hack is not as difficult as some of the other SM hacks released recently.
