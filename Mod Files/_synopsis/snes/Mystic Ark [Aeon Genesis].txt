Mystic Ark, commonly (and improperly) known as "The 7th Saga 2 in some circles, is an RPG by Enix that spans worlds, and embeds a lot of adventure/puzzle elements into the genre. Disnesquick did the programming for our font, and the text was translated by Ian Kelley. You'll pardon the brief description, but it's after midnight, I've been working on this game virtually every available moment for the past two weeks, and I'm really, really tired. But the patch is out, so I guess it was worth it. I'm pleased with the result, but it took one hell of a lot of effort to get this far.
