Super High Impact was one of the most hard hitting football games before the NFL Blitz series was created, with 18 teams and over 30 plays per team. The console versions are based on the Midway arcade series of the same name. The game has a Hit-O-Meter which often leads to massive brawls. Based on the arcade smash hit back in the days, featuring the three famous words: EAT THIS!!!, FIGHT!!!

Tips:

Super High Impact

Easily block kicks
When the computer is going for a field goal or extra point, take control of one of the defensive players all the way in the back of the field goal block formation. When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form is the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.

Easy defense
When on defense, pick the Suicide defense and take control of either one of the two nose guards. Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.
