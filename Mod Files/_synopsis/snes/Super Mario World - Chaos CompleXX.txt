Hehe? this hack is probably the biggest bullshit hack ever made. It's garbage! This hack is full with glitches, bad colour palettes, annoying and simple level designs, and a lot of message boxes with senseless and funny comments - very bad english included. Made as a spoof of the typical bad newbie hacks. Play it? and have fun? :D

NOTE FROM Rx: I seriously think that this may be my all time favorite hack.  It might get old after I play it a while, but I've never laughed at a hack like this one before.  Seriously give this game a try.
