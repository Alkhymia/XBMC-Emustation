_________________________
This patch gives Richter his unlockable outfit from the Sega Saturn version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It was never implemented in the PSX version cause the game was rushed to be released but you can see him wearing it in the background when fighting Werewolf/Minotaur and when meeting Maria after fighting Hyphograph.

Extra 1-ups
To get an extra 1-up, beat each stage without getting hit. If you come out unscathed (no, you cannot get hit
and eat a frankfurter), you will receive a 1-up after every stage you complete.

The Key's Secret
After collecting the Key item which goes into your sub-weapon box in Stage 3, if you have 15 hearts or
more, use the Item Crash button. While to most people it seems to do nothing more than make a question mark
appear over your head, if the key itself makes contact with an enemy or boss during this brief
animation, they'll sustain heavy damage. The best part of this secret is while you must have 15 hearts or more
to enable the item crash, actually using it consumes ZERO hearts allowing the attack to be used continuously! It also has the highest attack power killing most enemies in a single hit even if used regularly as well (Up + Attack) and once again consumes no hearts however to balance it's attack power, it's also the closest range 'weapon' in the game needing to be used immediately in front of the enemy.
