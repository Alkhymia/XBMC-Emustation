_________________________
Super Turrican 2 featured more action than the first part and used Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound as well as many "Mode 7" effects, but sacrificed the big levels of the original Turrican games. The major addition is a grappling arm, similar to that used in Bionic Commando, which can be used to swing between platforms and grab power-ups. The game was released on the Virtual Console in North America on September 29, 2008.
