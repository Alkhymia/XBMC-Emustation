_________________________
Taking a page from Chrono Trigger, this patch allows you - upon finishing the game - to start from the beginning with all of your items, stats, and PSI intact! In this enhanced version, all events are reset, eliminating the event-glitch problems in the original. As a result, however, you will not be able to Teleport to places you have not been yet. Even with this limitation, you'll be able to cut a swath through your enemies quicker than ever before.
