_________________________
Sparkster is a 16-bit generation side scrolling platformer produced and released in 1994 by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, directed by Hideo Ueda (Axelay). The eponymous main character is an opossum knight who fights an army of wolves and robots. He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances.

Although it is another game that features Sparkster, it has no storyline continuity with the Sega Genesis versions of Rocket Knight Adventures, thereby making it more of a spin-off, or perhaps an alternate universe instead.

Sparkster was awarded Best Sound Effects of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.
