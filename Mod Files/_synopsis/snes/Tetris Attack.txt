Tetris Attack is a puzzle game in which you rearrange the order of a stack of panels in order to clear them. As the stack begins rising, switch two horizontally adjacent panels. If you place at least three identical panels in a row vertically or horizontally, they will disappear. If the stack of panels touches the top, the game is over.

--From the SNES Tetris Attack instruction manual.

Overview:

Tetris Attack is a very fun and addictive addition to the Tetris series. I used to play this game for hours and hours. I love the use of colors and the graphics on this game. The music was very catchy also. Tetris Attack was just a pleasure all around. The controls were simple and responsive. The replay ability of this game is very high, as with almost any puzzle game. I recommend you give this game a try; be careful though, you may get hooked.

Directions:

You can play against the computer or your friend in several different ways. The game plays like this. Make three or more blocks that match touch, and they will dissappear, allowing you to score. Do this by moving your cursor to two blocks you want to switch and press B. Whenever you score, the blocks will stop moving up for a second. When you connect more than three blocks together it is called a combo. The way to get really big combos is to try to match up four or five of two different colors at the same time. The more you connect together the higher your point score will be. The pile will also stop for longer periods of time when you this.

Blocks left hanging will fall, and if they fall beside two or more blocks that match, you will start a chain. These can go on for a while if you try to make changes to the bottom while the chain is happening so you can keep it going. Chains will also stop the pile longer than normal scores. On top of the point score bonus, whenever you make combos, or chains, your opponent will get garbage dropped on his screen. He will, however, be dropping it on you at the same time if he is any good. To get rid of garbage simply score with at least one block that is touching it, and the piece of garbage will turn into blocks. If you pay attention, when the blocks are falling you can make changes to the bottom for chain points that will land more garbage on your opponent.

In endless mode you play until your stack has reached the top. Time trial requires you to reach a certain point score before time runs out. Stage clear is a mode in which it gives you a certain amount of blocks to clear before you can move on. There are several stages to beat in this mode. In puzzle mode you must clear a puzzle in a certain number of moves in order to move on to the next.

Start vs. mode with 90 continues
Enter these at the 1P vs. password screen. When it says ERROR! keep pressing the B button to backup to the menu
that says new game and password and select new game. Choose a difficulty level and start the game.  Now when you loose it will say you have 43 or 90 continues.

DCYYYQRL start with 43 continues
SSSSSSSS start with 90 continues

Secret Character
Go to the Player vs. Player character select screen, then hold L + R on both controllers for a few seconds.  If you did it right, the question marks (?) at the bottom of the screen will be replaced by bosses.

Guaranteed Victory vs. CPU
If you have a controller with a 'turbo' option for buttons A or B, you can use the following exploit against the CPU so that you always win!

First, when you turn on the game and Yoshi appears in front of a blue screen and says 'Nintendo, ' press B, A, L, L. You should hear a confirmation code when you input the cheat correctly. This will remove the 'freeze' that occurs when you or your opponent makes a combo or a chain. In other words, the blocks never stop rising. After entering the cheat, activate turbo for either A or B. Once you are competing against your CPU opponent in split screen, place your cursor over any two blocks or one block and an empty panel, and hold down turbo. The panels will switch back and forth so quickly that your blocks will not rise, nor will garbage blocks fall on you! Eventually, the speed of the rising blocks will surpass the CPU's ability to get rid of them and you will win!

Although it takes a while in later stages, you can use this exploit to beat every difficulty in VS. Mode.

How to control the cursor in How to Improve Mode In any of the sessions hold down the button.

Time Trial x? chain bug
In Time Trial, you get progressively more and more points for larger chains until the 13x chain. However, if you keep a chain going any longer than the 13th link (x?), you don't get any chain-link bonus points.  For this reason, you should never let a chain go past the 13th link in time trial.

All Endings
Good Ending: Beat the game using no continues.  Bad Ending: Beat the game with at least one continue.

Move Yoshi on Credits Screen
After you've beaten the game on Medium difficulty or higher and the credits are rolling, hold SELECT and you can use the Control Pad to move Yoshi around in the background.
