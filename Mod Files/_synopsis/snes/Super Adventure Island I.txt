Super Adventure Island is just what it claims to be - Super. Super Adventure Island is a great addition to the series; it plays much like all three of its counterparts, only better. Superior graphics, much more like cartoons; also better sound, and improved game play.

Now the story line is similar to the first three, only the names have changed, and it is some type of flying mage or something that has stolen the girl. The weapons have gotten better, and the more you collect, the stronger it gets, so grab all the weapons you can. Have fun in this action packed game, and anyone who loved the first three should love Super Adventure Island.

Directions:

Just like all the other Adventure Islands, keep moving or you will die. Collect fruit and other foods to keep you going strong. Collect weapons along the way. Plus you still have your old skateboard.
