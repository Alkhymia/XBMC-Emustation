Super Goal! 2 (Takeda Nobuhiro no Super Cup Soccer in Japan) is an international football (soccer) video game published by Jaleco for the Super Famicom and SNES consoles. The Japanese version allows players to compete for the Super Cup either with or against Takeda Nobuhiro, the greatest football player in all of Japan. There are teams from Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and even Asia. The North American release (published as part of the Goal! series) removed the references to Takeda.
