_________________________
First the Desert Madman, then the Jungle Drug Lord... now a new evil challenges the Strike C.O.R.E. right here in America! Ruthless media mogul and political maverick H.R. Malone secretly plans to destabilize the U.S. government. Crush this rebellion at all cost!

--from the SNES Urban Strike instruction booklet

Another helicopter shoot-em-up in the Desert Strike tradition. This time, the evil psycho villain is a Presidential hopeful who lost his grip on reality when he lost the election. Urban Strike takes you to various destinations around the United States, following his movements and foiling his schemes to cripple our civilization.

Interestingly, Urban Strike shows a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers in 2001, although the method of attack differs, the game's primary villain attacks New York with a laser weapon.
