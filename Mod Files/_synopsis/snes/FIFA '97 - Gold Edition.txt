_________________________
The biggest change in FIFA '97 was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players, with motion capture provided by David Ginola. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and even features the Malaysian league. The gameplay on the PC and 32-bit consoles, however, leaves a lot to be desired and is very sluggish. These versions also feature commentary by John Motson, partnered by Andy Gray, with Des Lynam introducing the matches.
