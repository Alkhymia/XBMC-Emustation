"This is a modification of the game Final Fantasy 2 US Version 1.0. This makes the game MUCH harder and adds a bit of new flavor throughout the game."

Don't let the difficulty discourage you, this hack is really fun and a lot of things have been changed. Expect to see new monsters and many items from the original Japanese FF4 restored.
