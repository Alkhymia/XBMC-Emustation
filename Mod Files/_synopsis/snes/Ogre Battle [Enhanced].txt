_________________________
Two hacks created by red_bird and combined by Stupot1 for this enhancement hack:

Ogre Battle version 1.02

This hack offers tweaked stat growth and modified job trees. Dragoners/dragon masters are female, skeletons and ghosts can evolve, and, because the creator can't change items yet, beast masters can use the dragos item to get a sex change.

This patch will only work with a headered ROM.

Dragoner/Dragon Master Fix

This patch moves Dragoners and Dragon Masters from the Fighter class tree to the Amazon class tree. Using a DRAGOS on a Beast Master will still change him into a Dragoner. Both classes also have different alignment, charisma, and minimum level requirements reflecting their status as sister classes to the Beast Man/Beast Master classes.
