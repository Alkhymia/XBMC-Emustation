_________________________
This hack is essentially a “New Game Plus” for Super Metroid. While the map layout itself hasn’t been changed, the tile arrangements within each room has been altered. Normal and Hard difficulty patches are included.

To some, rearranged tiles by themselves may not mean much. However, combined with Hard mode, THE Another of Super Metroid is the “Master Quest” that Super Metroid never had.
