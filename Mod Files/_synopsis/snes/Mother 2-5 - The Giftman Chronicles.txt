Trouble strikes on the eve of EB No Matsuri! Ness and his friends must team up to save the world from an evil menace that would destroy the holiday spirit and do away with strawberry tofu forever! :O This hack was the winning entry of the 2003 Hexmas Hackfest, and as such it's full of EarthBoundy, Christmassy goodness.
