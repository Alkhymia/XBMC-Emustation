I've been a fan of Super Mario Kart since I first played it in the early/mid nineties. Late last year I happened upon a romhack called Super Mario Kart: Pro Edition and was very impressed at the quality (though I was humbled by its difficulty). It inspired me to start my own hack of the tracks, with a focus on maintaining the feel of the original game.

Every track has been replaced by one I've created completely myself, including the Battle Mode courses. I've tried to avoid putting in overly complicated or silly courses like some hacks of this game have, but at the same time I've snuck in a couple of new ideas.

The AI works in all courses, and offers a challenge, but is far from unbeatable.
