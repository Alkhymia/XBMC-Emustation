_________________________
'Cliffhanger' has a double meaning. One is the primary focus of wall jumping.

The second is uncovering the truth behind your mission.

For each map station you encounter, you will also receive Chozo Lore.

The canonical storyline is also changed, in that there never was a M1, M2 or SM.

Nor was there ever a Mother Brain.
