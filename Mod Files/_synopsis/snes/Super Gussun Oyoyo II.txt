It's Tetris plus Lemmings except they're freaky little guys and they're all over and they freak out all the time and run off cliffs and it's OMG hard!

Translation Description:

Complete and looking good! Everything is translated except for a few background images of unimportance - read the readme for details.

Also read the readme for important gameplay details, and for a couple things that may be regarded as bugs but actually aren't.

Look just read the readme okay?

Also, watch the attract mode for some crazy-awesome techniques crucial to gameplay that you might otherwise miss. It makes the game look nice and intimidating!
