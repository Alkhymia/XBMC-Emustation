_________________________
Spellcraft is based on the PC game of the same name. There is a beta of the game floating around on the internet, and seems rather complete. It is compatible with the Snes mouse, although it seems rather clunky (for instance, you must click both buttons to get to the menu). Developed by Ybarra Productions.

Nintendo Power mentioned in their May 1993 issue that they expected the game to be released in the fall of 1993.
