_________________________
All's I can tell is, this is the first RPG Maker with prettier graphics. The battles are still in first-person, and there's a few new things, like vehicles. Were vehicles in the first one? Maybe they were. This review kind of sucks.

Translation Description:

KanjiHack did an excellent job on the second RPG Maker game. Very few things are left untranslated, which makes you perfectly free to make a complete RPG. All that's left to do (basically) is the game's sample RPG.
