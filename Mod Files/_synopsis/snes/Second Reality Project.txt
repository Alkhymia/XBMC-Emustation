_________________________
This is an easier version of the original Second Reality 1 Project. It's called SNES-Version, because this one is definetely beatable, if you play it on a real SNES without savestates! The game for itself, it's still hard, but absolutely possible to beat. A lot of things are changed in mostly every level to decrease the difficulty. Many more midway points have been added, gameplay is edited, some enemies are deleted, more power-ups are added, and so on. I'm sure you will notice some changes. Enjoy it! :D
