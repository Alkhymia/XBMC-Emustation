Despite the defeat of Trebor, Werdna, and L'kbreth, dark times once again threaten the kingdom of Llylgamyn. So once again a party of adventurers must venture forth to vanquish the evil.

Wizardry V represents a complete revision of the gaming system used in the first four installments, with larger mazes, new spells and character classes, and an expanded system for combatting and interacting with creatures.

Have both good and evil characters in the same party.

Normally, good and evil characters will not travel together (i. e. you can't select both from Gilgamesh's
Tavern) But, here's how you can get them both in one party. Take all the evil (or good) characters that you want, bring them out into the maze, and quit the party.  Then, bring the characters of the opposite
alignment out, and do a character search where you quit the first party, you can then have them join, and travel together.
