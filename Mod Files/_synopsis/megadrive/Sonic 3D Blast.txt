Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island, known as Sonic 3D Blast in the US, was released on the Sega Genesis and Saturn in 1996, and also released later on the PC. In the opinions of many, this was a fairly mediocre Sonic game, due to the sluggish gameplay and rather boring aspects that haunt the stages of the game. The music in the Genesis version, however, is widely considered to be some of the greatest in the series, and has spawned numerous remixes across the web. Co-composer Jun Senoue was later brought back to do the music for Sonic Adventure, often using arrangements of Sonic 3D's music.

It was the third to last first-party Saturn game released in Japan, where it was a Saturn exclusive until the release of Sonic Mega Collection which finally brought the Mega Drive version to Japan. It was also the last Sonic game for the Mega Drive.
