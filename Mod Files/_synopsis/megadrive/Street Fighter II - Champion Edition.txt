Street Fighter II': Champion Edition, called Street Fighter II Dash in Japan, is an upgrade to Capcom's Street Fighter II released in arcades. Capcom ported it to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition in the US and Europe and Street Fighter II Dash Plus  in Japan.

Many consoles and computers have received Street Fighter II in one form or another, but during the early 1990s it seemed that Nintendo were at a slight advantage in the console wars thanks to Capcom's release of the original Street Fighter II on the SNES. With the upgrade, Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting also being a Nintendo exclusive, many Sega fans grew worried that they would not be able to play a version of the revolutionary fighter on the Sega Mega Drive, however, Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition calmed fears, giving users all twelve Street Fighter II characters available to play from the start and including the hyper modes seen in Hyper Fighting.

There were many revisions of Street Fighter II in the arcades, and each time a revision was released Capcom insisted in bringing the new version to home consoles. This meant Super Street Fighter II also saw a release on the Sega Mega Drive which although adds four new characters and stages, is still very similar to this release.

The Mega Drive version of the game has since been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.
