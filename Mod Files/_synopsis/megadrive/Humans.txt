_________________________
The Humans is a 1992 game by Imagitec Design Inc. and GameTek released for a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive. The Mega Drive port was only released in the US.

The game is an action puzzle game similar to Lemmings. You control several cavemen to achieve various predefined tasks in a set amount of time.

For whatever reason, the Mega Drive port only allows you to choose between listening to music or sound effects, not both simultaneously.
