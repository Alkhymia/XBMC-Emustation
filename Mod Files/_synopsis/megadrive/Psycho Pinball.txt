_________________________
Psycho Pinball is another pinball game in the style first introduced in Pinball Dreams and later popularized in Pinball Fantasies. Standard features of these types of pinball simulations include an animated backglass display, multiple bonuses including a multi-ball, extra ball, etc., and background music that changes based on active specials.

There are three main tables:

- The Abyss (Aquatic theme)
- Trick or Treat (Horror theme)
- Wild West (Western theme)

...but an additional gimmick is a fourth Psycho Pinball table (circus theme) that has bonuses that can launch you to the other three tables, leading to massively high scores (and very long gameplay times).

Hints:

- Extra ball -
To get an extra ball pause the game and press Down, B, C, B, Right, Right.

- Play mini games -
To play the minigamess at any time during the game press: B, A, B, B, A, C, A, C.
