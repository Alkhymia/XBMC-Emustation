Valis III is a 1990 action game for the TurboGrafx-16 CD by Telenet Japan. It was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 and released in the US and Japan. It was the first Valis game released on a Sega system (the first two games would follow).

After the events of Valis II, the Dark world is being destroyed. The fortuneteller Leigh informs the Dark world's king, Glames, that they only have six months before it is destroyed. Hopeless, Glames decides to become king of both the Human world and Dreamland, but knows that Nizetti is controlling the power level of the Valis sword and that any attempt to invade either world would result in Yuko coming with a full-powered Valis to destroy him. Nevertheless, he takes the risk, knowing his sword Leethus, is just as powerful as Valis and when they are combined.

Of course, Yuko doesn't know any of this this. But Cham, another warrior, does.
