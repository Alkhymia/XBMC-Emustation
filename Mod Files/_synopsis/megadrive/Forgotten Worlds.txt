Forgotten Worlds is a shoot-'em-up developed by Capcom in 1988 for the arcade and ported to the Sega Mega Drive by Sega in 1989, and a Sega Master System port in Europe and Brazil in 1991. You are a team of two guys (a white guy and a black guy; one-player mode has only the white guy) trying to stop a giant blue gorilla with gold jewelry from taking over the city.
