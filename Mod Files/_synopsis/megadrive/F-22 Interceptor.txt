_________________________
F-22 Interceptor: Advanced Tactical Fighter is a flight simulation shoot-'em-up game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive. It has the player pilot a fictional F-22 jet fighter, blowing up airebourne enemies and ground targets. The game was released in 1991, a full fourteen years before the F-22 Raptor came into service.

The game is widely criticised for its slugglish controls and lag, partly because F-22 Interceptor tries to render 3D polygons in certain locations. It is notable for having multiple camera perspectives, however - something not seen in many video games of the time.
