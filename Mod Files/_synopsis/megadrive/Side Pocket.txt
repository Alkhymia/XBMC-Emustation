Side Pocket is a 1986 arcade billiards game by Data East. It was "ported" to the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear (US only), and SNES in 1992, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

There are three game modes: "Pocket" (the original arcade game, but without move count limits), "9-Ball," and "Trick." "Pocket" and "9-Ball" are typical billiards games. "Trick" has you performing a trick shot to get a ball around bumpers and into select holes in one shot.
