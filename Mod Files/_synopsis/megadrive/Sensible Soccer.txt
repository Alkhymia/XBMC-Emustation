Sensible Soccer, or Sensible Soccer: European Champions is an entry in the Sensible Soccer series of football games. Despite its name, the Sega versions of Sensible Soccer are in fact based upon the Amiga/Atari ST Sensible Soccer 92/93, an update to the "real" Sensible Soccer which was released exclusively for these computers.

This Sensible Soccer was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Mega CD, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. In North America, the Mega CD version is called Championship Soccer '94.

An update in the form of Sensible Soccer: International Edition was made available for the Mega Drive.
