The Punisher is a beat-'em-up game for the Sega Mega Drive, based on the comic book series with the same name. It is a port of an earlier arcade game by Capcom, and stars The Punisher (player 1) and Nick Fury (player 2) attempting to defeat The Kingpin (also the antagonist of The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin).

The Punisher is one of the few examples of Capcom bringing one of their many arcade games to the Mega Drive and not to the Super Nintendo.
