Socket, known as Time Dominator 1st in Japan, is a platform game released for the Mega Drive in 1993. It was developed and published by VIC Tokai and stars a time travelling duck named Socket, built to "fight" in the "mascot wars" initiated by the rivalry between Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The game was released in Japan and North America, but not in Europe.

Socket borrows many elements from Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequels, causing it to be labelled as a "Sonic clone". Like Sonic there is an emphasis on speed, with the game offering several "High Speed Areas" in an attempt to woo fans of Sega's game. There are also "labyrinth" areas, which have a greater emphasis on exploration of the level. Items are collected by destroying capsules, similar to Sonic, and a time attack mode is offered.
