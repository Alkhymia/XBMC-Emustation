The game's story is different in Japan and US/Europe:

Japan: Alisia is the daughter of a sorcerer killed by evil Baldour's followers after her father banished Baldour in a cocoon to outer space, which has since crashed back to Earth, leaving Alisia to defeat Baldour and his followers.

US/EU: Alisia is a female adventurer who is the only one who can destroy the evil delivered by a silver star that has returned to Earth (implied that Earth had managed to deal with it once before).
