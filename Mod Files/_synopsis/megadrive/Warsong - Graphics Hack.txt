_________________________
Another victim of localization was Langrisser, at least graphically. When it became Warsong, Treco redid a few of the character portraits. Not really a big deal, and some might even prefer the changes, but this patch will revert the graphics anyway.

This patch is more interesting when combined with D's text hack, which fixes the names to better match Langrisser. Make sure you apply this graphics patch last.
