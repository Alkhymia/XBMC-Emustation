_________________________
Air Diver is a 1990 shoot-'em-up by Asmik for the Sega Mega Drive. Middle Eastern terrorists have created a military force world powers cannot take down with their own militaries and it's up to you to stop them with your F-119 stealth fighter.

The game plays like After Burner and G-LOC: a 3D flight-simulation shooter where, like G-LOC, you are situated behind the cockpit.
