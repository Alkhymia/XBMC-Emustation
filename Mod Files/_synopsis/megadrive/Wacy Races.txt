Dastardly and Muttley are set on winning (or sabotaging) the annual Wacky Races. A racer bearing a strong resemblance to mario kart with the Wacky Racers from the Hanna Barbara cartoon.

Might have made a pretty good competitor for Mario Kart if the game had been completed. The known beta lacks the polish of a finished product, but is playable and looks decent enough, the worst bit is the poor sound.
