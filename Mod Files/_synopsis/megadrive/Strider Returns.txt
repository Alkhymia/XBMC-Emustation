Strider II, known as Strider Returns: Journey from Darkness in North America, is a sequel to Strider, released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System in 1992 and the Sega Game Gear in 1994. It should not be confused with the later release of Strider 2 which was developed in-house by Capcom - Strider II was developed by U.S. Gold, who, at the time, had the rights to the Strider license outside of Japan.
