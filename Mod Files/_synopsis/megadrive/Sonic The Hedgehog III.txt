Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third game in the classic series released on the Sega Mega Drive and the second in the "Death Egg Saga" that started in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, continues in Sonic &amp; Knuckles, and ends at Sonic the Hedgehog 4. Introducing Knuckles the Echidna and further expanding the world of Sonic the Hedgehog, the game (when connected to its direct sequel through the use of "Lock-On Technology") is considered to be one of the best in the entire franchise, and has become the standard that every two-dimensional Sonic title has been compared to.

The game was also met with a huge publicity campaign, connected to the date it was released in the United States. February 2nd, traditionally known as Groundhog Day, was renamed "Hedgehog Day" by Sega. In the U.K., Sega of Europe approached the pop group Right Said Fred to create a song suitable for radio play, which resulted in the Sonic-inspired single "Wonderman".
