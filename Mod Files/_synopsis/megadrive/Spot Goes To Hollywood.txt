Spot Goes to Hollywood is an isometric sequel to Cool Spot. It was developed by Eurocom and published by Virgin Interactive in 1995 for the Sega Mega Drive, with significantly enhanced versions with different levels appearing on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1996. These versions were developed by Burst. A SNES version of the game was planned, but cancelled. A Sega 32X port was also seemingly in development, only MANIAC Magazine mentions it, giving it a 75.
