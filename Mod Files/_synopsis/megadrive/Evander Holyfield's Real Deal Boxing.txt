Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, also called Evander Holyfield Boxing in Japan, is a 1992 boxing game for the Sega Mega Drive by Sega and Acme Interactive.

In Career Mode, you can create your own boxer with several predefined appearance settings and stats (which are mutual - changing one will change the others appropriately). In Exhibition Mode, you can only choose from various professional boxers.

The graphics and match engine would be reused in the 1994 game Greatest Heavyweights.
