Super Hang-On, also known as Hang-On 2, is a 1987 arcade game developed by Sega AM2 and the successor to Hang-On. It was released in the full deluxe simulated-motorcycle cabinet later as Limited Edition Hang-On in 1991, but technically it was built on the arcade hardware that powered Space Harrier.

Ports were released for the Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, Sega Mega Drive and ZX Spectrum. Super Hang-On was also released for the Sharp X68000 computer in Japan. The game also appeared on several Mega Drive compilations, namely Mega Games I (bundled with the console as Mega Drive Magnum Set), and 6-Pak.
