Taz-Mania is a 1992 platform game developed by Recreational Brainware and released by Sega in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. It is based on the cartoon series with the same name, and stars Taz the Tazmanian Devil on the search for seabird eggs. It is unrelated to the Super Nintendo and Game Boy games with the same name, aside from the Taz-Mania license.

Taz-Mania was a fairly popular game, and received good reviews when it was released for being one of the first games to look like a Warner Bros. cartoon (previous attempts had been held back by hardware restraints). The game was followed by Taz in Escape from Mars.
