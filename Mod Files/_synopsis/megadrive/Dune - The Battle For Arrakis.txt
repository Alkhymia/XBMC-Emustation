Dune II: Battle for Arrakis, known as Dune: The Battle for Arrakis in the US, is a strategy game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was also translated to German as Dune II: Kampf um den Wustenplaneten.

Battle for Arrakis is a complete overhaul of Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, a DOS/Amiga game released a year earlier. The Mega Drive version features streamlined controls, gameplay tweaks, new levels and an entirely new set of graphics. Dune II is considered a milestone in the real-time strategy genre, though was bettered by Command & Conquer a few years down the line.
