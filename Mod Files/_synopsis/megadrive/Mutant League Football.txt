Anything can happen when the most awesome mutants battle to prove who rules the galactic gridiron. 16 vicious teams of aliens, robots, trolls, skeletons and super-humans. Set the "Death Index" from Rough, all the way up to Annihilation. Call wild plays or nasty audibles - when the QB throws a bomb, it's the real thing! Watch instant replays to see where the body parts land. Throw TNT at the halftime marching band.
