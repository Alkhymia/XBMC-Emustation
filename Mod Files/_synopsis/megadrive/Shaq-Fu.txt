Shaq Fu is a video game developed by Delphine Software and was released, among other systems, for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear. It is a fighting game which stars basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, who has accidentally been transported to "The Second World" and tasked with saving the land from a mythical sorcerer named Sett Ra. Though it is often praised for its fluid animation and vibrant graphics, the game has been the subject of ridicule for its nonsensical plot and bad controls.

The Sega Mega Drive version is notable for including five more playable characters and three new stages (The Lab, The Wasteland, and Yasko Mines) than its Super Nintendo Entertainment System counterpart. Unfortunately the story mode is shorter than in the SNES version, but as a bonus, players can also walk down the stairs past Gargoyle's Peak to fight a blue version of Beast. The Amiga port was based on the Mega Drive port, but features less music and background animation has been removed.

The Sega Game Gear version only has six selectable characters, no tournament mode, and no in-game voices.
