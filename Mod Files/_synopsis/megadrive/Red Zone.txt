Red Zone, known as Hardwired during development, is a Sega Mega Drive game released in 1994 by Zyrinx. It is noteworthy for achieving sprite rotations, 3D vectors and full motion video; things that were often considered impossible to do on Mega Drive hardware. Zyrinx were previously responsible for Sub-Terrania, and the two games share similar graphics and logos.
