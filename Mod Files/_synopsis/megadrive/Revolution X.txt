Revolution X is a light-gun arcade game developed by Midway featuring the rock band Aerosmith. It was brought among other consoles to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn in 1994 and 1996, respectively, with the Mega Drive version not released in Japan.

Revolution X has Aerosmith in a dystopian version of 1996, fighting against the government who have declared war on youth culture. It was very poorly received, mostly because despite it being a light gun game, no light guns were supported in the home ports. All home ports also have some level of censorship - the Mega Drive and Saturn versions tone down the amount of blood, while the Mega Drive version also tweaks the exotic dancers.
