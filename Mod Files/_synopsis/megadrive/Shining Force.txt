Shining Force, known as Shining Force: Kamigami no Isan in Japan, and otherwise known as Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention, is a turn-based tactical role-playing game released in 1992 published by Sega for the Mega Drive and the first of the tactical Shining series. Its development was a conjoined effort between the independent studio Climax Entertainment and Sonic Co., a Sega second party that was formed to create the previous Shining game, Shining in the Darkness.

It was rereleased several times for other systems and was remade in 2004 by Amusement Vision, renamed Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon, but this title is not considered to be canon to the series even though the story in common between the two titles seems to be more accurate than the original translation. Other media associated with this game include an encyclopedia, several game guides, a soundtrack release, a manga series (3 volumes) and The Curse of Zeon, a six part story published in Sonic the Comic (issues #73-78).
