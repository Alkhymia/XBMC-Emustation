After Burner II is the sequel to After Burner, developed by Sega AM2 in 1987. The game is essentially the same as its prequel, however now features a throttle control which allows the player to adjust his/her speed during gameplay. There are also three new stages, bringing the total to 21 and various gameplay and music tweaks.

Whereas the original After Burner saw ports to simpler video game consoles/computers such as the Sega Master System, After Burner II was ported to more advanced 16-bit systems including the Sega Mega Drive, J2ME, and TurboGrafx-16. After Burner II also saw release as part of the Sega Ages: Volume 1 compilation on the Sega Saturn, and is playable within Shenmue II.
