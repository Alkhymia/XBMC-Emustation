Turbo OutRun is an arcade sequel to OutRun released in 1989. It was released as both a stand-alone arcade cabinet and as an upgrade kit to the original OutRun. Though not the first sequel to OutRun, Turbo OutRun is considered to be the first "true" sequel, having been built by a similar team at Sega AM2 with the arcades in mind.

Though very different to the rest of the series, Turbo OutRun is arguably closer to Yu Suzuki's vision for the original OutRun, being set in the United States of America and featuring various scrapped ideas such as a checkpoint system.

Turbo OutRun wasn't as popular as the original game, but offered numerous graphical upgrades such as weather and road obstacles which would be included in other OutRun sequels to follow. Like its prequel, the player drives a car which looks suspeciously like Ferrari, however rather than being a Ferrari Testarossa, it is a Ferrari F40. Like OutRun Ferrari were not consulted during the development of this game.
