Its heyday may be long gone, but the Sega Genesis is still holding on. Amongst certain retro fans, the interest in the old 16-bit console is still strong. 2008 alone has seen the second commercial release of a Genesis game in our millennium (Super Fighter Team's Legend of Wukong) and the first European Mega Drive Championship, while the first exclusive Genesis release in a decade, Pier Solar, is expected to be shipped in the near future.

Nowadays, these new releases have become possible because of fans, enthusiasts, and tinkerers who have devoted their passion to the Geneses as the console of their choice. They've decided to not only play the games on the machine, but to also look into it to see what makes them tick. Up to today though, mostly working with emulators and communicating over the Internet, the Sega Genesis still has a very active homebrew scene.

One particular field of interest for these hackers, of course, is the forerunner of its success: Sonic The Hedgehog! It was he who gave the Genesis the edge in the console wars of the early nineties. The Sonic games on the Genesis are among the most lauded and acclaimed video games of that decade, so it comes to little surprise then, that the Blue Blur has found a particular interest amongst hackers.

Hack Description: 

This is a hack which fixes the "Spike bug" and also implements a near perfect rendition of the Spindash. There is animation while doing the spindash like in the later games. The only thing missing is the dust underneath.

Special thanks to Lightning &amp; FraGag for their guides on how to implement this.

For some reason it doesn't like opening in a level editor, I don't know why. However, if you decompress the original Sonic 1 and decompress this ROM, you can open those decompressed original Sonic 1 files, then after you edit them, recompress them into the edit? I Think.
