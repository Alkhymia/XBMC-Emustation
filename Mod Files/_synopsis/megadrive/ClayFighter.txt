ClayFighter, is a fighting game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Interplay in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. This game is a port from the Super Nintendo, with several gameplay changes taken from the updated SNES version, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition. The game was most known for its colorful graphics, with each character rendered from clay to give the game its unique look.

The game features eight playable characters, battling each other to become the 'King of the Circus'. The one-player game has the selected character battle through several matches, including a few rematches against previously beaten opponents, before fighting the game's final enemy, N. Boss. Each character has a set of special moves performed with special button combinations. When a character receives heavy damage, the word 'KO!' will appear above them, if they are hit with a special move during this time, they will take extra damage.
