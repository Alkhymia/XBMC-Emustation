_________________________
During the summer of 1996, Saturdays were traditionally spent on The Nashville Network with programming related to fishing, and this game made everyday a Saturday afternoon watching TNN on the player's cable TV or satellite TV. Even players who were stuck with terrestrial TV were interested in fishing and found it interesting, even though they couldn't afford the huge satellite dishes at the time, or lived with trees in their western angle, which made satellite broadcasting impossible until late 1998.
