In the year 2001 a candidate for public office, H.R. Malone, is found out as a criminal (despite having political messages promising eliminating crime) by the US Special Forces team of the previous games. This leads to a call to an associate to investigate and stop the Special Forces team from interfering with the setup of a superweapon. Seemingly unbeknownst to Malone, that associate is actually a Special Forces infiltrator leaking the information... but the limo he is to leave in explodes, and the rest of the team is called in to stop Malone with stop the leaking of what little information they have.
