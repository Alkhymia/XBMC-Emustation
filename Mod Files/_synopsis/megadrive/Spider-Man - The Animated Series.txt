Though the Sega Mega Drive version of The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin was called just Spider-Man, Acclaim released its own game called Spider-Man for the Sega Mega Drive in 1995. This game is based on the animated series that aired around this time. A somewhat different SNES version was also released. Special red plastic versions of the cartridges also exist in North America.
