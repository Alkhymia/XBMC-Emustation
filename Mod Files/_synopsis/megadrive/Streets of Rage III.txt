Streets of Rage 3, called Bare Knuckle III in Japan, is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released by Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is the last part of the Streets of Rage series and a sequel to Streets of Rage 2.

The game features several enhancements over Streets of Rage 2 such as a more complex plot, multiple endings, longer levels, more in-depth scenarios (with interactive levels and the return of traps like pits) and faster gameplay (with dash and dodge moves). Weapons can now only be used for a few times before breaking and can now be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters have been added along with several cutscenes to give the story greater depth. Controls are identical to its predecessors.

Compared to its prequels, Streets of Rage 3 is a less common and more expensive game to find second-hand in its original Mega Drive form. It has, however, been released for the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and for the Wii's Virtual Console service. The game also appeared in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Streets of Rage 3 was not as successful as its predecessors for several reasons, most prominently the soundtrack. Though still composed by Yuzo Koshiro like the previous installments, Koshiro took a more experimental approach with the music inspired by Detroit's hard techno scene which was popular in Japanese night clubs at the time. It is said to have fared poorly when transitioned to the Mega Drive's sound chip. These problems are exacerbated on a PAL console, due to the unoptimised drop from a 60Hz refresh rate to 50Hz, effectively ruining large parts of the game.
Prototype screenshots show that a motorcycle stage was planned, with some code still present in the final ROM. It is unknown why this feature was axed.
