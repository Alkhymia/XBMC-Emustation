Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, or simply Maximum Carnage is a beat-'em-up game based on the Spider-Man universe. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1994.

This is one of the rarest Mega Drive games in Japan along with Acclaim's WWF Raw. Rather than roll out a line of exclusive Japanese packaging, Acclaim opted for giving the Japanese European packaging with very minor changes. As a result, this is the only game in the Mega Drive's official library to have the same product code across all regions (internally the game's code is T-81256-50 in Europe/Japan but the packaging says otherwise).
