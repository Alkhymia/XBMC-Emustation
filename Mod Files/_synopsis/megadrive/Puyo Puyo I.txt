Puyo Puyo is a Japanese puzzle game developed by Compile as a spinoff to their Madou Monogatari series of RPGs.

The original Puyo Puyo was released in 1991 for the MSX2 computer and contained a basic one-player free-play mode, missions, and basic two-player mode. However, Sega and Compile worked on a heavily expanded version for the Sega System C-2 arcade board and released it in 1992. This version has been ported to various consoles, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear, and has formed the basis for the entire Puyo Puyo series.

In North America and Europe, it was initially released in a heavily localised form, the Sega version being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
