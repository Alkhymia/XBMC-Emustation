Streets of Rage, called Bare Knuckle: Ikari no Tetsuken in Japan, is a beat 'em up video game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. Its success meant that versions for the Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System were produced, with the latter being a European exclusive. It was the first in the Streets of Rage series and is a popular choice for compilations and Mega Drive re-releases for modern video game platforms.

Streets of Rage was primarily Sega's answer to Capcom's Final Fight, a very successful arcade game which Capcom had chosen to port to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Perhaps worried that this would divert attention away from the Mega Drive, Streets of Rage was created as a Sega exclusive, developed internally by Sega AM7. At the time of release, beat-'em-up games were very popular and Sega's title was no exception.

The music for Streets of Rage was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who had previously offered his talents for Revenge of Shinobi. Koshiro's soundtrack would be widely praised, and he would be carried through into the development process of two sequels, Streets of Rage 2 and Streets of Rage 3, respectively.
