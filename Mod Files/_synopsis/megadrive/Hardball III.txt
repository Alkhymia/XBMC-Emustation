HardBall III is a baseball game for the Sega Mega Drive and a sequel (or update) to HardBall II (which skipped the Mega Drive). The Mega Drive version was not officially licensed by Sega. Also available in a rental version for the Nordic consumers and was probably released in Europe in a small number.
