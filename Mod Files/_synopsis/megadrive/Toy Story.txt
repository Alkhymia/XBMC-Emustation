Toy Story is a Sega Mega Drive game based on the film with the same name developed by Traveller's Tales and Psygnosis and published by Sega. Similar versions were also released for the Game Boy, Super Nintendo and Windows PCs.

As well as having platforming segments, the game is notable for being one of the few Sega Mega Drive games to have a stage in the first-person perspective, something that the Mega Drive was not expected to be able to handle. As well as this, one of the other technical feats was the MOD player in this game, allowing the Mega Drive to play back Amiga music files, specifically used for the menu screen and credits. This is the only game on the Mega Drive to include the player.
