_________________________
The Dalsis Empire has laid seige upon the Castle of Baltia to seize the legendary sword WARSONG. In a desperate attempt, King Alfador sends his only son, Prince Garett, into the countryside, away from impending death. Now Garett must rally his allies from across the kingdom, and lead their valiant armies in a battle against the Empire to retrieve the sacred sword! But, time is running short! Command troops and choose your mission commanders. Unite with loyal allies and charge into campaigns that forge the destiny of a realm. Between you and the path to victory lie dangerous rogues, the steel of Dalsis, and a confrontation in the ultimate showdown against evil!

Gameplay:

The player controls a group of heroes or commanders to accomplish some goals each phase. They are joined with non-controlled allies to battle with enemies commanders. Before each phase, the player can purchase up to eight army units from a single type for every one of its heroes. The type of the available army depends on the hero class (e.g Griffons can only be purchased by Dragon Knights) and have different prices. At the end of each phase, any survivor army provides some amount of cash for the player to use next time.

After each battle, the winning commander gains experience that allows him to upgrade to a more powerful class. If a hero dies, he is lost forever.
