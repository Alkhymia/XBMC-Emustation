Space Invaders 90 is an update to Taito's classic arcade game, Space Invaders released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1990. Due to the delay in bringing the game to North America, the game was retitled Space Invaders '91 for this region. In Brazil, the wait was even longer, so the game was simply labeled Space Invaders when it reached Brazilian shores. The game was not released in Europe.
