Trouble Shooter, called Battle Mania in Japan, is a shoot-'em-up developed and published by VIC Tokai for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 in the US and in Japan in 1992. A Japan-only sequel, Battle Mania Daiginjou, was also developed. The player plays as both Mania Ohtorii (Madison in the US version) and Maria Haneda (Crystal in the US version), a sister team called the "Trouble Shooters," who are called to rescue the King's son, who has been kidnapped by the crime group Blackball.
