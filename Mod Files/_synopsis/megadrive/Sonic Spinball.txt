Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball is a pinball game (using Sonic as a ball) combined with the storyline of the Sonic the Hedgehog. The games title is a pun on pinball and Sonic's famous spin move. It is the only official game to incorporate the characters and setting of SatAM, and one of only two for Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (the other being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine).

The plot revolves around the Veg-O-Fortress, Dr. Robotnik's new mass-roboticization facility built in and around the Mt. Mobius volcano. Sonic must use the fortress' special "Pinball Defense System" to his advantage, working his way up from the bottom of the volcano's interior by stealing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable, destroying the doctor's boss guardians and, eventually, taking out the massive roboticizer itself, the Veg-O-Machine. The grand finale is at a launch hangar built around the volcano's crater, as Robotnik attempts to escape Mt. Mobius in a rocketship before it erupts.

The game is unique as it was coded entirely in the C programming language when the norm was assembly.
