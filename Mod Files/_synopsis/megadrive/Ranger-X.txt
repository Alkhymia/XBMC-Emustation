Ranger-X, called Ex-Ranza in Japan, is a run-and-gun game developed by Gau Entertainment (who were bought by Nextech shortly after the game's release) and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993.

You play as a robot fighter called EX-CP who shoots at specified targets in a level while destroying the various enemies and ammunition you may encounter. You can move left to right freely (so if you miss a target you can go back) and can either walk or hover up and fly, but will come down automatically after you release up or stay up too long.
