Bio-Hazard Battle, called Crying: Aseimei Sensou or simply Crying in Japan, is a 1992 shoot-'em-up game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive.

The planet Avaron was plunged into deep biological war, and a retrovirus was synthesized to try to defeat the enemy. Unfortunately, the plan backfires: the planet is rendered nearly inhospitable, and the only survivors of the virus are sent to space to await a time when the new species of creatures that survive or thrive on the virus pose little enough a threat to set up a new colony.
