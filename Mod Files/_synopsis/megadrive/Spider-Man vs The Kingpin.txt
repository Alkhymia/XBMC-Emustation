Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, commonly referred to as just Spider-Man and also referred in the Mega-CD as The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, is a platform video game based on the Spider-Man Marvel comic book series. In the game you control Spider-Man, who must defeat various enemies and famous villains in an attempt to stop a bomb and save New York. Mary Jane is also kidnapped by Venom.

The game was initially released on the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System in 1991, being the first the one that got more recognition. This version was later updated for the Mega CD release, with refined levels, graphics and a CD audio soundtrack. The game was very successful, so much so that some sources claim that two thirds of Mega Drive owners owned this game in some form or another. In Australia, the game was eventually bundled with The Incredible Hulk.
