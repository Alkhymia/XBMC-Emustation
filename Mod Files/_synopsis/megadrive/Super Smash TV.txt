Smash TV is an arcade hit by Williams Electronics, first released in 1990.

The game was brought to a variety of platforms by Acclaim, including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES, Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, SNES, and ZX Spectrum. It has recently been re-released on the Xbox Live Arcade service. The game was followed by a semi-sequel Total Carnage, which did not prove to be as successful.

The Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo ports were called Super Smash TV, though are essentially the same game and the title screens were left unchanged.

Johnny Cage from the Mortal Kombat series is said to have completed the Smash TV course.
