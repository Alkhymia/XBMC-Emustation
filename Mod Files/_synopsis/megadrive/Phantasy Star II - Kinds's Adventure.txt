Translation Description:

Full English release in typical MIJET fashion. That means, VWF, dual language support by region, and top quality work. No known issues. A patcher program is available on the author's website if you prefer it over the typical IPS patching solution.

Update:

A major overhaul of what some critics are calling "the Blade Runner of very short text adventures."
