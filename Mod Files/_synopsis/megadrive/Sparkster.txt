Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is a 1994 platform game developed and published by Konami for the Sega Mega Drive. It is a sequel to Rocket Knight Adventures. Even though the intro screen refers to it as Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, it was only referred to as Sparkster on the US and EU packaging. A game known only as Sparkster was also released on the Super Nintendo but is a different game starring the same Sparkster character. Later a sequel just called Rocket Knight was released for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.

The game stars an opossum named Sparkster who carries a sword and jetpack on a mission to stop King Gedol from taking over the Kingdom of Zephyrus and kidnapping Princess Cherry.
