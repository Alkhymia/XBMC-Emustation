Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye (not to be confused with Shanghai II, a Sega Game Gear game) is a Sega Mega Drive mahjong game and a sequel to Shanghai. It was only released in North America before seeing a European Virtual Console release.

Activision were slow to port this game to the Mega Drive. Its sequel, Dragon's Eye Plus: Shanghai III had appeared on the system in Japan three years earlier. According to former employee Tom Sloper, this was because they were not happy with the way that one turned out.
