The hero Laden has approached the throne of the evil Gyra preparing for a fight, only to discover that Gyra is in fact Laden's long lost brother, Roki. Roki offers Laden the chance to join him in global domination; Laden refuses in shock, and Roki calls his servants, Clauss and Salome, to begin overthrowing King Lorelei and stealing the ELEMENTAL. The three disappear, leaving Laden to have to stop them by force.
