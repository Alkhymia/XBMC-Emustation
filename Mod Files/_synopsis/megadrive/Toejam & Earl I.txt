ToeJam &amp; Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It stars two extraterrestrial rappers who, by way of pilot error, end up crash-landing on Earth. While there, they must search for the missing pieces of their spacecraft in hopes of reassembling it. The game frequently parodies and satirizes 1990s urban culture, and includes common 90's slang and a funk soundtrack. Much of this charm is what drew people toward the game. The game was followed by Toejam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron.
