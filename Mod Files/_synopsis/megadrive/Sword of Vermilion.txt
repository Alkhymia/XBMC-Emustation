Sword of Vermilion, known as Vermilion in Japan, is an action game developed by Sega under Yu Suzuki and released for the Sega Mega Drive in late 1989 (Japan)/early 1991 (US/Europe).
Erik V, king of Excalabria, is overthrown by Tsarkon, king of Cartahena. Before he dies, Erik tells his most trusted servant, Blade, to take his infant son and the family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom, and escape, raising the baby as his own.

Eighteen years later, Tsarkon's forces approach Wyclif, the town where Blade took the baby, requiring Blade to reveal the boy's true identity as Prince of Excalabria and sending him off to save the land by collecting a series of rings starting with the Ring of Wisdom.
