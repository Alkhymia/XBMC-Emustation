_________________________
Vectorman 2 is the sequel to Vectorman, released in 1996 for the Sega Mega Drive. Though it claims to be a direct sequel to the original game, Vectorman 2 takes place mostly in the present day, rather than an urban futuristic setting seen in Vectorman. As one of the last titles to be released for the system, Vectorman 2 did not see a formal release outside of North America on the Mega Drive, but was released in Japan as part of Sega Archives from USA Vol. 3. Gameplay is identical to its predecessor.

Vectorman 2 has re-appeared in a number of compilations, including Sega Mega Drive Collection, Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection and even Sonic Gems Collection.
