_________________________
Although repetitive and a bit shallow, After Burner does a wonderful job creating realistic illusions of speed and 3D depth. Viewed from a third person, behind-the-plane perspective, this fun, graphically impressive, over-the-top shooter puts players in a high-speed fighter jet, firing a gun and lock-on missiles at incoming planes. Banking frequently decreases the chances of being hit by enemy fire. Suspension of disbelief is very easy in this game, especially when playing the sit-down, cockpit cabinet version.
