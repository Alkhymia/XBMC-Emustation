_________________________
This sequel to Rainbow Islands sees a return to the gameplay of Bubble Bobble, but with Bub and Bob in their now-human forms.

The boys must clear a series of screens of bad guys - who take slightly more esoteric forms than the angry caterpillars from Rainbow Islands - and again pick up a whole bunch of power-ups.

But this time they're armed with umbrellas! Oh, okay then, parasols...
