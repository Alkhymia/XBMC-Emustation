_________________________
This is a color hack for Metroid II. I used the Game Boy Colorizer for this. As there have been other color hacks for this game. I found I had a different vision in mind. So I made this more luminescent and thematic version. I looked for a continued feeling from the original nes game. Please enjoy this color hack.
