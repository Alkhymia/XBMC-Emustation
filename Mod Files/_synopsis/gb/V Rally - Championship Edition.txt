_________________________
The GameBoy version of the popular  V-Rally series, includes 4 licensed cars and 20 racing tracks from different countries with varying weather conditions (raining on the English track, snow in Sweden etc.), and two game modes: Arcade and Championship. In Arcade mode you race against the clock, and in Championship mode you race against other cars to get to the finish line first.

You see the car from behind in the usual early racing game style, with symbols popping up to warn about turns and obstacles on the road.
