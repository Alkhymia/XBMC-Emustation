_________________________
In this game you play as Daedaleanopus. Your mission is to solve puzzles. These puzzles consist of placing shaped pieces into a space and completely filling the area with all the pieces- sort of like Tetris except you try to fill up all the space on the board. Each puzzle is timed and after every puzzle you get a password so you can continue your game later.
