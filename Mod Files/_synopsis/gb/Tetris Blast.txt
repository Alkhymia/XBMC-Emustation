_________________________
In this version of Tetris, the basic 'clear the line of puzzle blocks' element is still here, but with an added twist: inside the many block shapes are bombs. By linking the bombs while clearing the play field as usual (creating a line of blocks), more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode.

The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e. challenge, clear as many lines as possible, time trial, clear as many lines as possible before time runs out and 2 player battle.
