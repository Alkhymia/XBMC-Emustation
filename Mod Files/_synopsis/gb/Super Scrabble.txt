With all that Super Scrabble has to offer, even the most traditional Scrabble player will smile with delight. Watch the computer scan its 40,000+ word dictionary! ZOOM to any part of the game board for a close-up view. Think your opponent's trying to pull a fast one? CHALLENGE the word! Stuck trying to use your letters? Use the DUMP option to replace them! 5 skill levels and 4 different playing options make every game a mind-bending challenge!
