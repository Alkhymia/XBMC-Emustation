Enter the world of Dragon Seeds!  As a Dragonsage you will need to genetically engineer, and train (essentially &quot;ranch&quot;) your dragons for armed combat.  Plus, you can use memory card data from any game to create high powered dragons.  Dragon Seeds features a simple, RPG-like battle interface, tons of weapons and shields, and a two-player mode.
