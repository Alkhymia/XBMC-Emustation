According to Egyptian legend, the Egyption god Horus outwitted the evil god Set and imprisoned him in a secret tomb...

Five thousand years later, Lara Croft discovers the lost tomb and unwittingly unleashes the evil god Set, fulfilling the ancient prophecy of his return to plunge mankind into darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all of her wit and skill to reimprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...

Trivia:

Specially marked boxes had a free "Lara Croft mousepad" enclosed. These were the same as the official ones released in 1997 that sold separately.

The Millenium Edition of TR4 included a special preview of the Tomb Raider comic and a game card. But there were no changes to the game at all!!
