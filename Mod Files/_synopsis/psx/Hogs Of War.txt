_________________________
Command a regiment of hogs through different battlefields - all with the same mission: eliminate the enemy. Gameplay is comparable to the Worms games, but Hogs Of War comes completely in 3D. There are many different types of weapons to choose from, as well as the possibility to assign special jobs such as sniper, medic, etc. to the hogs.
