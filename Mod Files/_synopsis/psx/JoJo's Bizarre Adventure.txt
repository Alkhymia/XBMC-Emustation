_________________________
Based on the Japanese manga/anime of the same name, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a 2D fighter from Capcom. Take on the role of one of 18 characters and battle your friends in Arcade Mode, or take on the role of Jotaro &amp;quot;JoJo&amp;quot; Kujo and his friends in Super Story Mode as they battle their way to the evil vampire, Dio Brando, in order to save the world!

A Dreamcast version also exists, but without the Super Story Mode and a couple of missing characters. Both games were ports of Capcom's arcade fighter, JoJo's Venture and its update, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
