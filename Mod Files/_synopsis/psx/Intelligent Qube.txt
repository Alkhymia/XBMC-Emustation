Put your brain to work! A squadron of Qubes are coming at you, and if you're not quick enough to get rid of them, you're toast! Capture them, contain them, and confine them...score points for capturing big groups of Qubes! Just don't touch the black Qubes, because...well...you're dead if you do.

And the rules are very simple. If you lose, you die. So you know what to do, right? That's right...don't die.
