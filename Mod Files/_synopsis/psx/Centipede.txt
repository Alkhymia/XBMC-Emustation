_________________________
This is a remake or &amp;quot;modernaization&amp;quot; of the classic arcade shooter Centipede, originally released in arcades by Atari in 1980.  This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;:  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; isometric perspective.
