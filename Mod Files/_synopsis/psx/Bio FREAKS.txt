_________________________
A very violent 3D one-on-one fighter.  Take control of one of many well-designed bionically-enhanced fighters, and fight in a dangerous interactive 3D environment.

Most of the characters rely on distance attacks, which reduces the game to strategic fighting rather than a boxing match; interacting with the incredibly hazardous environment adds another dimension to the gameplay- while avoiding an opponent's gunfire by jetting off with your jetpack, you may just slam right into a buzzsaw coming out of the wall.
