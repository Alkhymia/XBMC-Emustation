This game is just nonsense as far as gaming logic. It's kind of like a guy's first visit to the proctologist -- you think you know what's supposed to happen and where things are going to be going, but all along its a lot more uncomfortable than you expected, and things constantly take a turn for the worse, and you keep wondering if maybe there's something you could do or change to help make the experience a little more smooth.
