Based on Luc Besson's science-fiction movie &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, the game let's you replay the story of the film as the main characters Korben and Leeloo. You're running and jumping Tomb Raider-style through a 3D environment, fighting the minions of evil that block your way. Korben uses the firepower of different weapons he picks up on the way, whereas Leeloo has to rely on strikes and kicks. After each level, you're rewarded with short scenes from the original movie.
