_________________________
The first Contra game for the 32-bit consoles and released exactly 10 years after the first Contra.

Unlike the original Contra and follow-ups, this is an overhead-view 2D shooter (with 3D graphics) that plays more like a side-scrolling Commando or Mercs.

The graphics are truly 3D; an option allows you to view them as red/blue images, and some packages of Contra: LoW come with 3D glasses to garner full enjoyment of the feature.

Hidden within the game – accessible on a certain level and through a secret code – are a mini-version of Gyruss and a Pac-Man-like game called Pactank.
