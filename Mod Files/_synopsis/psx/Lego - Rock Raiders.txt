_________________________
Based on the underground Lego universe, you must take control of a team of lego men and build your way through mission based levels, ranging from saving lost crew members, finding hidden bases destroyed in the rubble and building your base to gain new vehicles. As your crew grow in confidence, they learn new abilities like piloting skills or become explosive experts. All the lego pieces from the rock raiders series are there to choose from when building your base, and the lego men move just like the real thing (just without the hands pushing them along).
