In "One On One," two players go head to head in an attempt to knock down the wall their opponent is protecting.

The Atari version can be played with joysticks, plugged into control ports one and two, or with paddles, plugged into port number one. In the game, player one tries to protect the wall at the top of the screen, and player two defends the wall at the bottom.

The player's paddle (horizontal line closest to the middle section of the screen) is used to intercept the ball before it hits his wall and destroys a section. When the ball hits either player's paddle, it bounces toward the opponent's wall. En route, the flight of the ball may be changed or impeded by barriers or additional sections of wall which serve to make the game faster and more exciting.

Eventually, one or both players will lose enough wall so that the ball can go through it. The first player to get the ball past his opponent's wall wins the game and receives an appropriate victory message.

One On One is easy to learn and challenging. You'll keep coming back to play it again and again.
