Una Cum has abducted Storm's wife Corrine and locked her in his well-guarded laboratory. Storm and his Wizard friend set off to have her in a top-down arcade game similar to Gauntlet. You run around rooms which are all the same size, killing monsters and collecting treasure. A simultaneous 2-player mode is on offer.
