_________________________

This game was quite similar to Space Invaders & Phoenix, the game where aliens inch down the screen in waves to attack the player's tank. In Space Eggs, instead of firing shells, you shoot eggs and the invaders are monsters, space wolves, giant-bomb-throwing lips, and the most dangerous of all, killer fuzz balls. Killer fuzz balls that bounce and shake and move toward you with frantic inevitability. Space Eggs was a runaway bestseller for Sirius Software.
