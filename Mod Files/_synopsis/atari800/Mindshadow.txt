_________________________

At the beginning of Mindshadow you find yourself on a lonely beach in a lifeless hut. With a headache and no memory. 

The object of the game is to completely regain your memory. As you progress in the game a word or phrase will trigger memories of the past. Like most adventure games the fun of the game is centered on discovery of you and your surroundings.

Trivia:

There is a hidden picture known as "Yummy". It shows Brian Fargo (the boss of Interplay) cutting off the head of an unnamed programmer, according to Rebecca Ann Heineman, who was a programmer there at the time.
