(From the instruction manual)

In Moonmist, you are a famous young American detective. An old friend, Tamara Lynd, has written you a letter (included in the package), asking for your help. And so you have travelled to England to test your detective skills.

As the story begins, you are outside Tresyllian Castle - the old, dark, hauntingly beautiful castle where Tamara now lives. Tamara greets you, and you meet some interesting guests. But your visit soon turns to mystery, as a trail of riddles and clues leads you to a hidden valuable treasure.

But Tamara is worried about a ghost that is tormenting her. What does the ghost want? Is it jealous of her? Does the ghost want the hidden treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just someone dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, why?

Some of the characters in the game will treat you differently whether you play as a male or female character, and the game comes with four different variations (choosen at the start by picking a color).

Difficulty Level: Introductory 

Trivia:

This game allowed the user to choose his (or her) gender and select the main character's name. The outcome (or version) of the game you played was linked to whatever you said the main character's favorite color was. Four different version of the game were playable (provided you chose yellow, blue, green, or red -- I believe a version was selected randomly if you chose ecru or vermillion).
