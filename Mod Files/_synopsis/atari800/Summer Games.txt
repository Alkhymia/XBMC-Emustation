Summer Games allows up to eight players to compete in a series of summer themed Olympic events. The gameplay is similar to the other entries in Epyx "games" series. Each player can choose a country to represent, and then takes turns competing in various events to see who will win the gold medal! The game allows you to compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one event, or practice an event. The events available vary slightly depending on the platform, and may include:

Pole vault 

Platform diving 

4x400 meter relay 

100 meter dash 

Gymnastics 

Freestyle swimming 

Skeet shooting 

100 meter freestyle 

Rowing

the cart. version differs from the disk version:
- max. 3 players can play
- no highscore / olympic records save option

There is still the option to play one or all events (but it is still mising to play more than one but less than all events, e.g. to choose several events out of the eight available ones)... And with the cart. version one no more has to be a disk-jockey ("turn disk over")...
