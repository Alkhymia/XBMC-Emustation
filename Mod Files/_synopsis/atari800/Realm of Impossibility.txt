Zombies is a platform game in which the protagonist has to fight the titular monsters, snakes, spiders, and an array of other creatures in order to survive.

The dungeons the hero must traverse make use of visual effects, similar to those found in M. C. Escher's work, to create physically impossible scenarios. These structures serve as a basis for puzzles which must be solved in-between the fighting in order to proceed.

The game features a total of 13 dungeons with 129 different rooms. A cooperative mode with another player is also included.
