You were just a renegade space traveler, but as you passed the planet Syntron, your ship malfunctioned, and you were forced to land.  Now as you leave you ship, you notice that you aren't alone . . . you're surrounded by menacing and dealy Syntroids.  Survival is your only concern.

How to play Syntron.

Syntron is a game for one or two players using joysticks.  Select the level of difficulty ( level 1 = easy; level 2 = medium, level 3 = hard ) by pressing the OPTION key until the desired value appears.  Use the SELECT key to toggle between one- and two-player games.  Press START to begin play.

In single-player mode, one joystick is used to control both player movement and shooting.  With the trigger button releases, the joystick controls the player's movement about the screen.  With the trigger pressed, the joystick fires the player's gun in any of eight directions.  Remember, single-player mode does not allow you to move and fire at the same time.

In tw-player mode, the joystick in port 1 controls movement, while the joystick in port 2 handles firing direction.

There are three types of Syntroids.  The red ones, woth 70 points, are destroyed by a single shot.  Hitting a blue Syntrek turns it into a red Syntroid and yields 40 points.  The green Syntris is valued at 20 points and turns into a Syntrek when hit.

Completing the tenth wave (and every ten afterwards) will give you a 10,000-point bonus.

Syntroids to not shoot, but all are deadly to the touch -- and up to seventy aliens may appear in one wave.  The most fun can be had with two players working as a team.  One controls the direction; the other, shooting.  To pause the game, press the SPACEBAR.  Pressing any other key resumes the game.
