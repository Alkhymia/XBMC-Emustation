_________________________

You've been marooned by your crew in the vast wasteland of the Egyptian Desert. The burning heat causes you to think you are a brave explorer of fortune, but you have already been branded an Infidel. You are more likely to starve to death than finding the gold and riches that are hidden in the pyramids. 

Difficulty Level: Advanced

Trivia:

Copy protection for the game required the user to dig at a specific set of coordinates and translate hieroglyphics. The map and brief primer made these two tasks considerably easier, although it is possible to muddle through the game without them.

Infocom's first Tale of Adventure might have been called Pyramid. Though uninspired, it was used through the game's initial testing and had a loyal following due to its descriptive nature. Infocom's ad agency, Giardini/Russell, was unimpressed and suggested Infidel. Infocom was unimpressed: it sounded more like something from the Crusades than an exploration for a lost pyramid. But in combination with its distinctive logo and the proposed package design, Infocom relented. They even changed the game a bit to make it work better.
