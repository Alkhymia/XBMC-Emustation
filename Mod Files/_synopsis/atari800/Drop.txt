Catch the falling faces

You can never beat this game, just get better and better. It starts slowly as faces appear at the top of the playfield and fall towards the bottom. You move a dish laterally with the joystick to catch the faces before they reach the bottom. If you miss one, that ends your turn.

With every successful catch your score increases, and after a while bonus points accrue. However, the speed of the game increases too, and it is unlikely you will ever exceed 1000. A little "falling" sound accompanies the action.
