Trivia:

Controversy

One of the villains in the game is a OSHA agent. OSHA enforces Federal Health and Safety rights within the workplace and at least one California State Senator publicly accused the game of being anti-worker for depicting OSHA agents as villains, which prompted some retail stores to pull the game from their shelves. 

Title

One of the four large meeting rooms on the first floor of the "Mission Control" building of Electronic Arts Redwood City, CA campus is named Hard Hat Mack. The four meeting rooms are named after EA's first four games.

The front cover illustration, like most of the first Electronic Arts games, has the EA logo (not so) hidden in the photo. But it also appears more cleverly in the inside photo of the two developers; look for it as part of the falling lunchbox.
