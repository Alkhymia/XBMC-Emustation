Lost in space, in your small spaceship, you have to fight your way through endless fortresses of mounted turrets and asteroids, if you really wanna be a 'survivor'.

One of the first games made by Synapse software, famous for other well known shooters like Shamus or Shamus Case II. Survivor shares the same kind of gameplay, but also features a very large playing area for its time.
