_________________________

As a beginner and inducted into the "Guild Of Thieves", you must steal your way to the top - the Guildmaster is there to not only help you, but to make your life a living hell. Worst of it all is you're STILL in the land of Kerovnia.....if something makes it look tough to solve, that's nothing for a puzzle - something else will screw it up more. 

Trivia:

Feelies packaged with Guild of Thieves included an issue of "What Burglar" magazine (with encrypted game hints), a Bank of Kerovnia account card, a parchment copy of your indentured servitude contract, and a six sided die with a blank "3" face.
