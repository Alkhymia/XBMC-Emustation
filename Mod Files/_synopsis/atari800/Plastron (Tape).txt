_________________________

Planet Plastron is the last remaining source of fossil fuels. As Omni-Corp has been mining it exclusively for 500 years, they have excessive commercial power. To limit this, you head to the planet in the Scavenger One craft, collecting as much fuel as possible.

Gameplay is essentially Moon Patrol with a third movement dimension (steering the craft, moving it up or down the side-viewed screen). The surface is rocky and full of craters - falling into these damages the craft. There are gaps in the road, some preceded by ramps. Your craft can jump - you start with a limited amount but more can be collected alongside the fuel tokens. Some sections have enemy craft, either patrolling the ground or shooting at you from overhead. Each section must be completed within a time limit.
