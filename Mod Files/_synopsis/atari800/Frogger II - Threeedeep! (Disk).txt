_________________________

In Frogger II, you need to guide your frog to safety in three different locations. Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.

Trivia:

Frogger II has been released an numerous console and computer platforms, but the spelling hasn't been consistent from release to release. The PC version uses the spelling Three Deep, compared to other platforms which use the spelling ThreeeDeep!.

When playing on a true CGA card with an RGB monitor (including Tandy 1000's and PCjr), Frogger II uses a palette of green-red-cyan-white. This is done by setting the background color to green (instead of the default black used by most games) and using the tweaked red-white-cyan foreground colors (most video cards will display the foreground colors as the usual magenta-white-cyan, though.)
