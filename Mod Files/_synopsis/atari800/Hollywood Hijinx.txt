As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. They had no children of their own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to their charm. 

Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you remember her unusual will. You will inherit the entire estate -- probably worth millions if you can spend just one night in the house and on the grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't then you inherit nothing. 

And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far from Hollywood ...


Trivia:

Box contains Magazine "Tinsel World - News from Hollywood and around the globe, Vol. 35, No. 27", a Letter from Aunt Hildegarde Montague Burbank, a Photo of Uncle Buddy Burbank with poem on the back and your very own Lucky Palm Tree Swizzle Stick. 

The premise of this game is riffed on in Ivan Cockrum's 1998 game Foggywood Hijinx, and its title informed an inspired sample transcript for Jamie Murray's Bollywood Hijinx in 2001 -- an homage not yet stretched out to game-length.

Copy protection for this game required the user to have the photo of "Uncle Buddy;" well, actually the poem on the back of said photo. The three cardinal directions mentioned in the poem are needed in order to properly orient the statue in the front yard of Buddy's estate. Don't have the poem? Good luck getting into the house.
