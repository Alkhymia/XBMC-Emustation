This version has more arcade like sound and commercials.
 
Based on the 1980 Namco coin-op. The original arcade game was designed by Toru Iwatani, modeled after a pizza with a slice taken out. Pac-Man is the videogame industries' first animated main character. This version includes the arcade intermissions. The Galaxian bonus item in the arcade version has been replaced with an Atari logo.

The 8-bit cart version is missing the commercials.
