Licensed from K-byte/Kay Enterprises. This title only works on the older 400/800 models. Plays a little like Galaxian but it's very slow. In between levels the Mountain King guy walks onto the screen, tips his hat, and walks off. Weird.

Blast the invading alien attackers to save your Star Base from certain doom!

Sealed in proton transportation capsules.  Alien Kritters hover over your Star Base.  As you blast the capsules away, heat-seeking aliens are sent hurtling toward your command ship.  You must be very agile to avoid them.

Even as you struggle to save your star base, free falling kritters plummet from the sky.  Shoot them before they hit your base!  Alien patrol kritters pass above the action; a direct hit gives you additional command ships.

You must be fast, you must be courageous.  Prove yourself or face the indignity of being carted off to the intergalactic junkyard.

From the box back.
