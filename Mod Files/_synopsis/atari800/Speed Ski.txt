Can you be the fastest one down the mountain?  That's your objective in Speedski.  Ski as fast as you think you dare, but remember, crashing into the trees or gates will cost you precious seconds.

Playing Speedski.

Speedski is a skiin simulation for one player.  You begin your journy down the slope either by pressing START or by hitting your joystick button.  The game may be paused at any time by pressing any key, and resumed by pressing OPTION.  Press START at tny time to start the game over.

Use the joystick to steer your skier.  Pulling back on the stick causes you to speed up; pushing forward will slow you down.  Steering back and forth will also slow you down, but not as fast as pushing forward on the joystick.

If you crash, your skier will get up again, but it will cost you some time.  To play again, press START or your joystick button.  (Try to beat my record time on course #1 of 0:35.56.).
