_________________________

Requires Dunjonquest - Temple of Apshai.

Upper Reaches of Apshai is an expansion module for Temple of Apshai, featuring a new dungeon (four levels with 150 rooms), and even something like a background story: You have to discover the secrets of Benedict's monastery and the cottage of Merlis the Mage.

Otherwise, gameplay is pretty much the same and resembles other graphical Roguelikes / mainframe DND-Clones: You're in control of a solo character, running through a dungeon, killing monster, getting experience, evading traps and finding treasures.

Trivia:

Every room is numbered, and has a description in the manual about smell, sounds, wind etc. Rogue's dungeons are randomly generated. Apshai's were designed. This is reflected in the room descriptions, which are in the manual for a reason; playing the game with the descriptions makes it much more immersive and interesting.
