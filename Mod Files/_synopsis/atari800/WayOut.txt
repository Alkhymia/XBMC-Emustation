_________________________

Wayout is an early use of first-person 3D perspective, featuring a small gameplay window but smooth 360-degree movement. You are trapped inside one of 26 mazes (composed of 90-degree direction changes) and must find the exit. The game records how many movement units you use up, and saves the best scores to disk. Up to nine in-progress games can also be saved.

You have a compass and a map-making kit, enabling the game to automatically map the areas you explore. These can be stolen by the Cleptangle beast, but you can chase him to get them back. 

You can't push against the wind without finding a special way of overcoming it. Fireflies automatically move with the wind, and can serve as a clue to its direction.

Trivia:

According to George "The Fat Man" Alastair Sanger, who developed the music for this game with Paul Edelstein, this may be the first game to used layered music, with multiple melodic lines overlaid, that got more exciting as more exciting events occurred in the game. 

He says, "There was a bass line and a melody line, playing simultaneously. It was a walking bass line and a 'jazz-scale' melody all over one chord.

"The program would randomly select a 'calm' bassline, play it for however long that lasted (2 bars, 4 bars), then check to see if the players were close to each other or a flag, at which time the program would cue up a 'tense' baseline. The same was happening in the melody line, but tension had to be even higher to cue them up, and the melody lines were shorter...and also unequal lengths.

"The net result created quite a few different variations, as the bass and melody would line up a bunch of different ways due to their staggered start times."
