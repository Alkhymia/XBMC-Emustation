Battle 30-foot waves, enemy fighter jets, bombers, and helicopters while dodging mines in this Galaxian clone that has a few novel twists. Your P.T. Boat can be moved left or right and can fire missiles to bring down enemy aircraft, but it also moves up and down, staying on the surface of the huge, slow-moving waves.
