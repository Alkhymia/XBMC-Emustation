Control a droid on the planet Andromadous trying to herd Ramboids (alien sheep) into a teleporter. First the droid has to travel through a chamber filled with constantly moving Ramboids. Then the Ramboids must be herded towards the teleport receptor in a particular order. As well as the droid's standard movement mode, it can also tunnel or dig through the caverns. In later levels, the cavern designs become more complex and moving blocks create further problems.
