_________________________

Three of the key battles of the American War of Independence are recreated here. The British army and American patriots can be played by either human or computer (with 3 skill levels). Each side's level of reinforcements and ammunition can be set on a 5-point scale. The smallest and shortest battle is Bunker Hill, while the Battle of Monmouth is distinguished by harsh weather, and Saratoga requires a different fighting style to the highly regimented one the British unsuccessfully used.

Trivia:

The game had two very nice (that means detailed) manuals, one with general gaming rules and one with unit statistics, tactical hints and related data. Also included were detailed maps of the three battle locations.
