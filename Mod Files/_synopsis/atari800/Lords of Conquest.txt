_________________________

Lords of Conquest is influenced by the boardgame Risk. You and your opponent start by selecting countries in turn from a map. This can be randomly generated based on requested numbers of countries and volumes of water, chosen from one of the 19 predefined ones, or created using the inbuilt editor.

Your army possesses infantry, cavalry and a water fleet. Natural or produced resources such as gold and iron are identified - countries containing these might be the best ones to invade.You can play at 4 skill levels, and decide how big a factor luck is. With calculations settled by the computer, players can concentrate on the power games.

Trivia:

This game is based on the board game Borderlands released by EON Publishing in 1982
