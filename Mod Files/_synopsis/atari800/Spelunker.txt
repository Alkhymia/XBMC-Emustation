_________________________

In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as dynamite to create obstacle-destroying explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.
