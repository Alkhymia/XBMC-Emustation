Cavernia is a platform game, set in a cave. As Teddy Arklethorpe, the player has to complete sixteen levels; finishing each level requires Teddy to collect all the treasures scattered throughout, then grabbing the key and getting to the exit. 

The gameplay is typical for the genre, with leaping across gaps, riding on moving platforms and leaping up to grab ledges. Monsters such as ghosts and mutants, and dangerous environment such as spikes and falling stalactites await throughout; contact with them means losing a life.
