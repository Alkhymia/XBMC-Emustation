In this game, you and two other men, George and Floyd, are on a mission to rescue a girl who is lost in the jungle. All three of you need to look out for alligators, elephants, birds, and many other wildlife that inhabit the jungle. Birds and Pigmies can be picked up for points. As stated earlier, you need to rescue the girl who is lost in the jungle, but if George or Floyd get to her before you do, you will have to restart the level. A "handicap" option is available.

On Atari 8-bit you could play 4 players simultaneously.
