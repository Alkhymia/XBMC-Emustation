Your magnetic Gold Grabber will help you in this Action! quest for the gold.

You are a Midian and are about to become a player in a robotic car chase contest.  The goal:  to gather as much gold as you can with your remote-controller GII (Gold Grabber), a magnetically powered vehicle.

This would be fine, except that the Midian Guardian Squad has decided four RIIs (Ramdom Rovers) should roam around the gold vault room, making your goal more difficult.  And that's not all.  The RIIs have GII sensors built in.  So, if they're within range of your vehicle, you can expect to be the object of a chase.

Luckily, there are six gold-transforming objects placed at variour locations on the board.  For a few seconds, they enable you to spin any and all RIIs, thus sending them back to their holding station.  Even when the RIIs come back again, still golden colored, you may spin them once more.

Hitting the gold-transforming objects awards you various points, depending upon the object.  Gas cans gain you 100 points, wax cans 200, dynamite 300, oil cans 400 and tacks 500.

But remember, this transforming power is given to you for only a short period of time.  Use it wisely, either to pick up more gold coins (100 points), or to try to hit as many RIIs as you can.

You will also find that many of the corridors are blocked by vault doors.  To open these doors, you must find the proper keys (100) for each.

The Guardians have also seen to it that, after you've gathered a certain amount of gold, a money bag will appear on-screen.  The money bag's value starts at 1,000 and increseas by 1,000 points each board, until it reaches 5,000--at which time it returns to 1,000 and starts all over again.

For every 10,0000 points gained, the Guardians will award you with another GII vehicle to smash up.

The speed of both your GII and the Guardians' RIIs will increase on every board, making the game more difficult.  If you action gets too hot for you, a touch of any key will pause and unpause the game.
