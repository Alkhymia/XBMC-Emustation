_________________________

Following the defeat of the evil krill in Enchanter, the intrepid apprentice have become a full member of the Circle, under the command of the famed Necromancer Belboz. Very soon, however, the hero notices that something strange has been happening to the master. He frequently talks to himself and seems to be under some sort of a malevolent influence - until one day, he is mysteriously kidnapped. Looks like the brave Enchanter must venture on a perilous journey once again, and bring back the leader of the Circle.

Sorcerer is a sequel to Enchanter, and is part of the Zork universe. Like its predecessors, it is a text adventure, in which the player interacts with the game world by typing combinations of verbs and objects. The spell system from the previous game is back; a new feature is the protagonist's ability to drink magical potions, which must be done sometimes in order to solve the game's puzzles.


Trivia:

Within this game is the first appearance of the vicious Dorn beast, which chases you through the deadly glass maze trying to make tasty stew out of you.

The name of the beast, "Dorn," comes from the then current Infocom director of marketing, Mike Dornbrook. As is often the case, there was some degree of animosity between the people who write the games and the people who sell them. No one but the designers know what Mike did to be memorialized as a disgusting, greedy, slavering beast (who falls to his untimely death).

In 1984, Sorceror was advertised on the back cover of Boy's Life magazine in an attempt by Infocom to reach a larger audience. The plan backfired when postal workers decided not to deliver that issue of the magazine on the grounds that it "advertised a satanic product".
