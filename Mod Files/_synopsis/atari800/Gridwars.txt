This was created with the "Arcade Machine"

According to Ross McNaughton

There were two versions of this game, 1 and 2-player (due to the limitations of The Arcade Machine I couldn't put both into one program). The two player was a somewhat better game, with player 2's ship firing downwards from the top of the grid.

Unfortunately the game required a whole disk so Page 6 could only include one on the flip side of a coverdisk, and they went with the 1-player version.
