_________________________

Mouskattack is very similar to Pac-man. You are Larry Bain, a plumber working for Rodent Rooter and you are attempting to get rid of all the huge rats in Rat Alley. You are pursued by 4 rats in a maze and you must set mouse traps to get rid of them all as well as make sure you traverse the entire maze ala Pac-man to complete the level.
