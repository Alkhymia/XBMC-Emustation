The Arcade Machine allows you to create alien blastfests Ã  la Galaxian. The editor has a wide variety of options: designing and animating enemies, players and explosions, giving the enemies instructions on how to move and fire, drawing background or title screens, creating sound effects and music and setting a number of gameplay rules. Created games can be saved to a self-bootable disk so the will run without the main program. A sample game is included.
