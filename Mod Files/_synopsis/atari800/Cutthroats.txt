_________________________

You live on small seaport Island called Hardscrabble -- hardly the hip place to be. Working as a professional scuba diver, you have the chance to salvage a sunken treasure from one of four shipwrecks, earn the respect of all the old farts and become wealthy beyond all imagination.


Trivia:

Cutthroats was the first Infocom game to come out in the famous gray box. Measuring 9" by 7 3/8" by 1", the package opens like a book to reveal the game manual, and the disk and package elements are packed in a re-closable transparent tray.
