_________________________

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards. The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles and alligators, and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.
 
This version has 2 person simultaneous play!
