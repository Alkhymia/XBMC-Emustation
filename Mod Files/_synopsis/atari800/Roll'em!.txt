Roll 'Em! is a fast-paced maze game written in Action!  You control a paint roller and try to paint all of the corridors in ten different mazes -- while avoiding three fireballs.  Your roller will be destroyed if they touch you, but you can temporarily escape by using the revolving doors scattered throughout the mazes.

Playing Roll 'Em!

Before you start a game,  you may choose which maze you want to begin with.  Use a joystick plugged into port 1.  Pull the stick toward you to go to the next maze; push it away from you to go to the previous maze.  Pus the trigger to start a game.

During a game, you can push SELECT to seed the game up and OPTION to slow it down.  Push START to return to the attract mode.  You can press the trigger or a key on the keyboard to pause the game.  Hitting the trigger or key again will resume it.

You start with three lives and get another for every 1000 points that you earn.

Wehn the game begins, a short tune will play.  Control your roller with the joystick.  You can move the stick in the direction you'll want to go before you get to the turn, and the roller will turn as soon as it reaches the corner.

The revolving doors can be both friends or enemies.  You can block the fireballs with the doors and escape, but y ou must paint under all the doors completely.  Since they give no indication of whether they've been painted under or not, a screen may look finished when it really isn't.  The only thing to do is check all the doors until you find any you didn't paint under.
