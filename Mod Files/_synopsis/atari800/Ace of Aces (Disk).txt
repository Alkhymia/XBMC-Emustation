Ace of Aces is a 1st person, 3D flight simulation. You're onboard a British RAF Mosquito, maverick fighter bomber. Your mission ... stop enemy trains, intercept the terrible german V-1 buzz bombs, sink the german U-boats and down the Nazi bombers. Are you ready for this challenge?
 
The multi-load cassette version is best saved for nostalgia purposes.
