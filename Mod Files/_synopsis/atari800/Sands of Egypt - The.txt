_________________________

The Sands of Egypt is set in the great Sahara Desert in search of the Tomb of Ra. The year is 1893 and you are the aristocratic British explorer, Sir Percy. Life as a great explorer has its excitement of recovering precious gems and gold trinkets, but currently you are hopelessly lost in the middle of nothing but sand. You will need to avoid dangerous snakes and cliffs, and find water before dying of thirst. 

This graphical interactive fiction game uses standard single-letter directions - N, S, E, W - for movement. This is a disk only adventure and allows for saving and loading directly to and from the program disk. It also has limited HELP features in game. The command parser is a standard verb-noun type (Go Pool).
