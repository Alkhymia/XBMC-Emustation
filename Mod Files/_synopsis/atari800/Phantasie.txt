The island of Gelnor has been taken over by The Black Knights, who demand sacrifices and homage as they travel from town to town. Defeat them and their master, Nikademus!

Phantasie is a classic role-playing game, and one of the first to introduce a "bank" for storing money in addition to expanding on the classic Wizardry-style gameplay of building your own adventuring party with traveling from town to town via the countryside, overhead views of dungeons, and multiple styles of attack.


Trivia:

The algorithm that distributes money and experience points is subject to integer rounding errors. So, if there are six members of the party trying to divide up 5 pieces of gold, nobody gets any gold because 0.83 gets rounded down to 0. :-)
