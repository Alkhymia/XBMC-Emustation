_________________________

The Temple of Apshai Trilogy includes updated graphical versions of three classic Apshai games: 

Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai 
Dunjonquest: Upper Reaches of Apshai 
Dunjonquest: Curse of Ra

Trivia:

Every room is numbered, and has a description in the manual about smell, sounds, wind etc. Rogue's dungeons are randomly generated. Apshai's were designed. This is reflected in the room descriptions, which are in the manual for a reason; playing the game with the descriptions makes it much more immersive and interesting.
