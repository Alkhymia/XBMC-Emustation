_________________________

The year is 1936, and suddenly the protagonist is abducted by the Leather Goddesses for the final testing in the plan which will enslave every man and woman on earth. These Leather Goddesses of Phobos are just finishing up their plans for the invasion of Earth. If the hero fails to escape and save humanity, the Leather Goddesses will turn the Earth into their pleasure dome.

Leather Goddesses of Phobos is an text-adventure with humorous overtones. The player uses standard commands in the text parser to observe his environment and pick up items. The game's 'naughtiness' level can be adjusted between Tame (G), Suggestive (PG), and Lewd (R).


Trivia:

69,105

Infocom's famous 69,105 number is used in this game to refer to the number of leaves contained in the sack found in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Copy protection

Copy protection for the game required the user to have access to the map and comic book that came with the game. The comic book gave the keys to solving a cryptogram in the game as well as navigating the catacombs (with the map). Without the comic the cryptogram is still fairly easy to solve. Even with the comic and map the catacombs are nearly impossible to traverse. 

Development

Designer Steve Meretzky aimed to have his previous game, A Mind Forever Voyaging, generate incredible controversy over its political commentary on the conservative policies of the Reagan administration. After it generated no controversy at all, Meretzky "decided to write something with a little bit of sex in it, because nothing generates controversy like sex." 

Extras

One of the software trinkets (called "feelies" by Infocom) was a scratch and sniff card with odors associated with the game. One such odor was, of course, leather.
