_________________________

Mech Brigade is a platoon level tactical simulation of armored warfare between the forces of NATO and the Soviet Union in the 1990's. The game may be played by up to 2 players who can either choose to play one of the 4 historical scenarios or may elect to build their own scenario. The game will automatically end after 15 turns (20 if there is an assault battle being played). However a game may be ended earlier or continue after it has ended if all sides agree. At the end of the game victory points will be awarded which will determine whether the battle was a draw, marginal,substantive or decisive victory.
