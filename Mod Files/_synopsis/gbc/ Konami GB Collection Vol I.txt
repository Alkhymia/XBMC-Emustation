_________________________
A quick hack I worked on. Made on behalf of those who have played CV Adventure and hated it due to certain drawbacks. Namely, the inability to take a hit without losing your Whips power. Also, the default speed of Christopher. I believe those who have played the game enough will love these changes. Perhaps if the game had been made in this fashion originally there may of been less neigh-sayers of this game.

There is also a patch which works for the color version of Castlevania Adventure which is found in Konami GB Collection Vol. 1.
