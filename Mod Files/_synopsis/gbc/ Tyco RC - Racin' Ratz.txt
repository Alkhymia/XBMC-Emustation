Mattel Media's Tyco R/C Racin' Ratz for Game Boy Color features Mattel's small-scale radio-controlled toys. In Racin' Ratz, players take on the role of either Chris or Betty and can wreak havoc with their R/C vehicles while trying to complete more than twenty-five missions through ten levels. Kids snag as many household items as they can get as they tear through the bedroom, the living room, grandma's house, the garage, and other areas of the house.
