That devious Tom has captured all of Jerry's friends and locked them away. But have no fear, because you have what it takes to rescue them! Guide Jerry through action packed, booby-trapped rooms as he locates and frees on friend at a time. Besides steering clear of mousetraps, there are plenty of other "mishaps" waiting to happen... thanks to that pesky cat. So be careful. Solve puzzles to collect clues to the "whereabouts" of the missing friends and set them free. Jerry can really use your help here. Are you up for the challenge?
