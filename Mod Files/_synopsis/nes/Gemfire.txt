KOEI made an incursion into the fantasy worlds of magic with this game.

Six magicians, each trapped inside a magical gem, are liberated from the crown Gemfire by Princess Robyn, daughter of the tyrannical ruler of Ishmeria, King Eselred. Fleeing across the length and breadth of the island nation, they each choose a leader from the greatest noble houses as their champion to topple Eselred and bring peace to Ishmeria.

Players select one of these noblemen and seek to unite all the provinces under their banner through a combination of warfare and diplomacy.
