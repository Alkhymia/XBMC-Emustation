Bram Stoker's Dracula is the title given to a number of games based on the 1992 film of the same name. Gameplay for each game varies greatly from platform to platform, but they all retain a similar plot based on the movie. You control a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula's capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.

The DOS version is an adventure game played from a first person perspective. The 16-bit console versions are side-scrolling hack-and-slash games. The Game Boy version is also a side scrolling adventure game, but places more emphasis on level exploration than fighting. Finally, the Sega/Mega CD version is a side-scrolling fighting game that uses full-motion video backdrops and digitized actors.
