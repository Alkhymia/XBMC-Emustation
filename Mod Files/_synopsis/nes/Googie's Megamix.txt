_________________________
This was Googie's first attempt at MM1 hacking, this hack throws Mega Man in all new different levels that are more challenging than the original levels. There's also some text changes in here too. So if you're up for a Mega Man challenge, try out this hack. There's also some minor graphics editing in here too, like the weapons and energy capsules were change into capsules from Mega Man 2. Enjoy.
