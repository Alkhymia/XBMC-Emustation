_________________________

For one or two players, KLAX makes you move fast - and think faster! Catch colored tiles coming down a conveyor belt. Score big points by arranging them in same-colored stacks of threes - vertically, horizontally or diagonally. A tic-tac-tile game if you will. Sounds easy? It is... until the tiles come tumbling at you so fast, you'll go nuts trying to catch them all - while figuring out where best to stack them before you run out of room! No matter how tough it gets, the hardest part is pulling yourself away from this fun, fast, and totally addictive game!
