The original Super Mario Bros. 2 was originally released in Japan because of it's "difficulty". It was later and finally released elsewhere on the Super Nintendo in the smash hit Super Mario All Stars, which included Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3, and the Lost Levels (the original Super Mario Bros. 2). It was again released on the Super Nintendo in Super Mario All Stars + Super Mario World.

Gameplay:

This is classic Super Mario Bros. game-play. You'll immediately notice a similarity to Super Mario Bros. 1, except for one thing, this is MUCH harder. There are plenty of new additions as well, such as the poison mushrooms, running hammer brothers, and warp pipes that take you bak worlds instead of warping you ahead. The difficulty is definitely high, which is great, but it might be a little too hard for some gamers. Most gamers, though, would be happy (and willing) to spend hours trying to beat this.

Hints:

- How to access World 9 -
To go to World 9, you must get to World 8-4 without using any warp pipes.
You will only have 1 life when you go to World 9, when you beat 9-4 the game will restart to 9-1 until you lose your life.

- How to access World A - D -
Each time you beat World 8-4, the game adds a star to the Super Mario Brothers 2 logo on the title screen.
When you have eight stars, go to the title screen and hold A and press START on the controller.
