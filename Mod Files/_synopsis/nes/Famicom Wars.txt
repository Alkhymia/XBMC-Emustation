_________________________
This is a pretty neat little game.. Well, from what I played anyway. I screwed up and made both players me, so I easily won. Still, it's a [system] Wars game, and while they can't all be as brilliant as Advance Wars, they pretty much all play the same. Except (wraith) doesn't like em.

Translation Description:

Seems pretty cool. He made little icons for the funky vertical menus down at the bottom of the screen! This patch should now be complete with the latest update.
