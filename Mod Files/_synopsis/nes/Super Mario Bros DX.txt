Super Mario Bros. DX is a complete graphics upgrade for Super Mario Bros., based partly on Super Mario Bros. 3 including a combination of directly-imported, modified, and entirely new graphics. Special attention has been paid to color. This hack may be combined with separate level hacks, or (if credited) used as a springboard for your own hacks.
