_________________________
Woo-hoo! This is a most excellent translation of a most excellent game. If you haven't tried it yet, Ys play very much similar to Zelda, but is twice as fun and the dialogue is 10 times more engrossing. And it's pretty challenging, too! This is definitely the version of Ys to get, unless you happen to read Japanese or own a Turbo Duo. Heh.

Translation Description:

Makoknight and Co. did an excellent job with the translation; this is truly what I'd call a flawless script. It's much truer to the Ys saga than the Sega Translation was, and much more grammatically correct. So, what are you waiting for? Find the ROM, download the patch, and have a blast!
