The game consists of five largely unrelated minigames. The main objective is to rescue Miss Piggy from the "Grumpasaurus", a being who has kidnapped her. In order to complete this objective, the player must assume the role of four different muppets (Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal), direct them in the collection four keys and subsequently confront the "Grumpasaurus".
