TETRIS is a new type of puzzle game from the Soviet Union that tests your reflexes. It's really simple to play. Seven different shaped blocks fall down the game field one after the other. The object of the game is to keep the blocks from piling up to the top of the game field. To do this, you can move blocks to the left and right, and rotate them as they fall. If you can completely fill in one horizontal line, that line disappears and you get points. If the blocks pile up to the top of the game field, then that's the end of the game. TETRIS is simple, easy-to-understand, but difficult to drag yourself away from!

TETRIS originally came from the word "tetra" meaning the number 4. By rearranging four squares, you can make seven different shapes which are the pieces used in this game.

--From the NES Tetris instruction manual.

Overview:

When this game was released in 1989, it became an instant classic, along with Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros. and many others! The Russian-themed music got into everyone's head, and people were playing Tetris even in their sleep. A huge hit that started a new era in video gaming.

Directions:

In this classic game, you must get through as many lines as possible! There are two modes: A and B. In Mode A, if you destroy 10 lines, you move up one level. In Mode B, you must destroy 25 lines! The Tetris pieces come in many shapes and forms, so use different tactics to prevail!

Controls:

A Button: Rotate pieces to the left
B Button: Rotate pieces to the right
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, make selections
Select Button: Hide preview of next piece

Hints:

Start With 4 Free Lines on B-Type Game
Start the game and wait for the demo. When the computer eliminates the four lines at once (makes a tetris), and the screen begins to flash, press start. Now start a B-type game. The screen will flash, and you will start with extra points plus 4 less lines to eliminate.

Warp 10 levels ahead
Select the level you want to go to and hold A, then press START, you will be 10 levels ahead.
