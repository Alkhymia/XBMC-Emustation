In this Jump'n Run, you take on the role of the Man of Steel and must free Metropolis from criminals in several missions.

You start the game as Clark Kent, but as long as you have enough energy, you can change into Superman. Apart from jumping and punching, Superman can also use different super powers such as Heat Vision, X-Ray Vision (makes certain enemies visible), two kinds of Super Breaths (one that freezes certain enemies) and Super Flight which takes him to different locations.
