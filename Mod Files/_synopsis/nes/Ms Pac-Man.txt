_________________________

Gobble, gobble, gulp. Ms. Pac-Man chows a power pellet and it's dinner time. Fly around the mazes at top speed while you dine on ghosts and score big points. Watch out! Don't let those little haunters get their hands on you or you're history.

The NES version by Tengen took a few liberties. It featured four different sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller mazes, and "strange" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let players make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster. It also allowed two people to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man, either cooperatively or competitively. The game also ended at level 32, at which point an intermission that did not occur in the original game took place, where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good bye.
