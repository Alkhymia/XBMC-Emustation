This hack is a continuation of the original Zelda II. It was created with one goal in mind, and that is to provide a challenge. Fortunately, there are 3 patches available to download: Easy, Medium, and Hard. This way, if you don't like challenging games, you will have other options to select from.

It will feel like a new game. Most of the overworld has been changed as well as the 7 palaces. There are all new puzzles in every single area of the game and some of them will most likely get you stumped! If you like Zelda II, then you will definitely like this hack.
