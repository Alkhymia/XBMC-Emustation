Are you ready for the real thing? In the jungle, everything is invisible. Including the enemy. Suddenly, a firefight explodes all around you. That's jungle combat as you saw it in the movie Platoon. Now, Sunsoft's Platoon takes you right into the action. You'll fight for your life against deadly guerillas and hidden snipers, always on guard against the booby traps and napalm airstrikes that could end it all in an instant. Jungle combat, as close as you'll ever want to get to the real thing. You've got it right in the palm of your hand.
