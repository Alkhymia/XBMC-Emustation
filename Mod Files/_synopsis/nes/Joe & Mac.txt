It started out as a warm, peaceful summer day. Joe was lying in the green grass daydreaming about brontosaurus burgers while Mac was away hunting for dinosaurs. Hungry and relaxed, Joe returns to the village... BUT WAIT! Where are all the cavewomen? And where is all the food? That bogus bunch of Neanderthal nerds must have kidnapped the cavewomen and eaten the food! With no time to lose, Joe must single-handedly rescue the beloved cavewomen... and find some dinner along the way!
