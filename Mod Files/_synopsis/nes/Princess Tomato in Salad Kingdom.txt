_________________________

Despite a simple and rather clich? premise (a knight must rescue a captured princess and restore order to the kingdom), its plot is fairly complex by 8-bit console gaming standards. Taking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player must defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby persimmon, who offers advice and helps throughout the quest.
