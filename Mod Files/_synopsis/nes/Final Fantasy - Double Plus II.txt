This is a semi-sequel (or more like an expansion pack) for my previous hack, Final Fantasy ++ (so if you haven't played that, then you really shouldn't be playing this). At any rate, this is quite a bit harder to beat than FF++, so n00bs beware. Also, one can consider this sort of a tribute to classic SquareEnix (the way they were?). It includes adaptations of various dungeons from FFs 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6, SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with a couple of new ones by me). And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are here for you to battle.
