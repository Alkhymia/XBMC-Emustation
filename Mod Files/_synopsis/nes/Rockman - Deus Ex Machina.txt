_________________________
Rockman Deus Ex Machina is one of the best sophisticated hacks in Mega Man II history. It is programmed almost every part of the game you've never expected before. The boss fights are incredibly hyperactive. Players find this hack a clear winner. Background Music is made by the author of Rockman No Constancy IKA. Additional patches were added by Misty in the Japanese 2ch boards about August 8th such as Hard Body and Weapon Modification. A must play for all expert Mega Man II players. Not newbies. Be sure you patch with the Japanese Rockman 2 ROM.
