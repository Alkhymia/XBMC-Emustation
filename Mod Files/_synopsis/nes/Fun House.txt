You're trapped in the FUN HOUSE! How do you find your way out?! You start the game with three rollerbladers. If you maneuver your way out of one room in the limited amount of time, you go on to the next room. But to move on, you must smack all the targets with your tomatoes as you whiz by. Pick up the power objects to gain advantages like more rollerbladers or more time.

It's a slippery, slimey trip through 72 rooms, full of blobs and boingers, flying banana chips and schmutz balls. So getting through the rooms gets harder and gooier as you go along. Have fun!
