Final Fantasy ++ (or Final Fantasy Double-Plus, or Final Fantasy Plus Plus) is a "re-imagining" of the very first Final Fantasy game.

What's been changed:

+ Redone graphics. (Mostly ripped from later games in the series.)
+ Redone enemies. (Many are new; some are returning enemies with new properties.)
+ Redone magic spells. (Magic is now divided into White, Black, and Time Magic.)
+ Redone weapons and armor. (Some armors now increase evasion rather than lowering it!)
+ Redone maps. (Most are similar to the original game's; some are totally new.)
+ Redone character class system. (See Read Me.txt for details.)
+ Two new pieces of music. (Adapted from Final Fantasy 4.)
+ Some other relatively minor stuff.
