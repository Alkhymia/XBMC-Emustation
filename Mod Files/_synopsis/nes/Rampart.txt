Attack, Defend, Fortify, Rebuild or perish! Your castle is under siege from invading hordes of evil knights and men-at-arms. Cannons and catapults. You blast away with everything you've got, then pick up the pieces and rebuild your walls before the next battle begins. You can choose from three different commanders. And battle the computer's cannons or another player via Game Link. Either way, it's a smashing new version of the towering arcade hit. Get into RAMPART today!
