There was a legendary "KING PAMERA" who maintained peace and order all over the world. Nobody could ever catch sight of "KING PAMERA". One day the king demon "BELZEBUT", had a wicked plot to bring the world into ruin by abducting the merciful "KING PAMERA", his beloved queen, and their beloved princess.

The brothers MIGHTY fought bravely against "BELZEBUT" in order to save "KING PAMERA". Every brother was defeated by the king demon except Jack, the youngest and lone survivor. Jack gained additional courage and challenged the king demon to a final fight, in order to restore peace all over the world. Good Luck Jack!
