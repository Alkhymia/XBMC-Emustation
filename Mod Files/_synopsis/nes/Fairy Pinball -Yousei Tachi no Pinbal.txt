I'm not kidding when I say that Video Pinball for the 2600 is far superior to this game. Choppy graphics and gameplay that defies physics make for a painful gaming experience. 

When I finished the short game, that blonde girl with oversized blue eyes looked so sad for me and the size of my.... um score.
