_________________________
FinalFacelift is a fun patch that changes the look, but none of the gameplay, of Final Fantasy for the NES. It's not a game itself, but only a patch file specifying minor changes.

That's a very modest description of this hack. Here's a short list of changes:

- Five letter character names
- Default names for characters
- Retranslated names for items, equipment, and monsters
- Touched up dialog
- Enhanced graphics (With censored graphics restored)

It may not seem like a lot, but it has been the base for countless Final Fantasy hacks and offers an enhanced gameplay experience on its own.
