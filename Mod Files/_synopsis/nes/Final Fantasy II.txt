It's a Final Fantasy game! Final Fantasy 2 has all the things you've come to expect from the series: music, plot, pretty well-done character designs.. What's not to like? Well, I'll tell you. The experience/level system is done away with in FF2, and replaced with a SaGa-like system in which your character only improves in the skills that you actually use. Granted, it's very different, and you'll either like it or hate it. I really couldn't stand it the first time I played the game, but now I actually kind of like it, although it makes the game drag on a LOT in places. Of course, FF2 has numerous things that can be exploited, allowing for all kinds of cheating (some prefer the term "time-savers") to take place.. such as making an attack and then cancelling it, attacking your own teammates to raise their HP, and.. Well I can't think of anything else. Anyway, if you like this sort of thing, by all means try it out, since it is definitely a good game.

Translation Description:

Apparently this translation takes great liberties in terms of dialogue; I'm not sure of course, it's just what I've heard from various people. Regardless, it's in English, and I certainly don't mind what's done with it, as long as the "spirit" is preserved.

And anyone who tells you that the new intro isn't cool is just plain wrong.
