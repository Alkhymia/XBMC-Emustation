Ahhh! After 10,000 years I'm free. It's time to conquer Earth!

The translation for Kyoryu Sentai ZyuRanger (Kyouryuu Sentai Juuranger according to GoodNES) is finally released.

The characters may look familiar to you, as this is the Japanese/original version of what would eventually come to America as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.
