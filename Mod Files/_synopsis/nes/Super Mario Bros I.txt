One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopaa tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.

The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.

Mario, the hero of this story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.

You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!

--From the NES Super Mario Bros. instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Mario Bros. was one of the great classics, and everyone has played it, but we will give you a little insight on the game. Based on the arcade game Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. became one of the most popular games ever. It had decent graphics and was fairly easy to play. You play either Mario Or Luigi, two plumbers that are trying to save the Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom from the dreaded King Koopa. Super Mario Bros. was the start of a great series that has continued to this day.

Directions:

Run, jump, and collect items, but most importantly keep moving. Collect Mushrooms to get bigger and flowers to spit fire. Collect coins to get extra lives.

Nine worlds, containing three levels each, stand between you and your goal. Find secret areas that might let you skip certain levels and save the princess. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Run, shoot fireballs
Start Button: Pause the game/Start the game
Select Button: Select 1 player, 2 player(or Duck Hunt if playing SMB/DH)

Hints:

Continue
If you die and lose all your lives, just hold A+B and press start at the start screen to start at the first level of the world you were in.

Extra Points
When finishing a stage you have to jump onto a flagpole as high as you can. To get the highest score possible, be sure to land on the pole as high as possible and try to land on the pole when the clock's last digit is a multiple of three. If you do this, fireworks will go off that give you extra points.
