The WakdHacks homepage describes Fuzzical Fighter as an RPG/Action game mix. That's completely wrong, but it shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the game. You can think of it as a side-scrolling shooter with RPG elements. As you fly around shooting stuff, you get money, which can be used between stages. You can buy new weapons or shields or engines, or you can heal yourself, or even warp to another stage if you so choose. The formula works wonderfully in this case, and while it's not a completely new concept nowadays (Tyrian's one of my favorite PC games (too bad it won't work on my computer anymore)), I'm sure that it seemed quite cool at the time, and it's still great fun to play.

Translation Description:

What's to say? It looks great! Just play the game already.
