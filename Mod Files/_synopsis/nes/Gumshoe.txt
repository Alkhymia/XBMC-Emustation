--From the NES Gumshoe instruction manual.

Overview:

STEVENSON,

I'VE GOT YOU'RE DAUGHTER.
BRING THE 5 "BLACK PANTHER"

HOURS OR ELSE! COME ALONE.

--story from the game intro to Gumshoe

Directions:

Gumshoe's controls are quite simple. Shoot the Gumshoe to make him jump. Shoot him repeatedly and he can fly through the air.

Shoot enemies and dangerous objects to destroy them. Sometimes items pop out of destroyed enemies. If you grab a potion you'll become Pink and be able to take one hit without dieing.

Shootable objects flash a white border whenever you fire.

You must collect all the diamonds, or you won't be able to enter the last level. 

Controls:

Just point and shoot!

Hints:

When the game over screen appears, fire a shot. You will be able to restart the game at the last phase (ala Super Mario Bros. continue code)
