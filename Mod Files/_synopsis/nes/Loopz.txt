_________________________

The main focus in on the playing board where random pieces of different shapes are presented to the player. The player must then try to make loops out of them. Once a loop is completed, all pieces involved disappear.

There exist three different play modes, two of which can be played with two players. The third mode of play starts with a loop already created and then takes away random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in after they show up.
