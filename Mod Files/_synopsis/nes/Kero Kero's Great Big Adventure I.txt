_________________________
Another Sanrio game. And believe it or not, it kicks ass! In this one, Keroppi's girlfriend Keroleen has been kidnapped (why?), and Keroppi goes off to save her. Sound familiar? Well, first you have to solve a bunch of puzzles before you can get there. Still sound familiar? Well it's not, dammit. You're not restricted to one type of puzzle either.. You have the odd lilypad jump-around-and-make-the-platforms-change-position game, and the platform game where they change color, and the underground staircase thing, and the extremely easy game where you just walk to the exit. It manages to stay interesting for quite a while, and is very fun to play. So, um, try it out.

Translation Description:

Musashi translated this. And it is very very nice. And finished!
