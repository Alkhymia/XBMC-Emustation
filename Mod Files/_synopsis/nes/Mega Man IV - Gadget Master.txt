Schwa: Over the years I have had a LOT of perseverations. Megaman was one of them for a while, and while I was in that state of mind I managed to produce my very first Rom Hack of all time, Megaman 4. A Rom Hack is what you get when you take a Rom and change the hexadecimal values inside the file. By doing this, you can pretty much change the game in whatever way you want. That's what I did with Megaman 4, using MegaFLE to help me (which is a Rom Hacking program btw), and the result is new colors, completely new level designs, a few new graphics, and overall a new game to explore!
