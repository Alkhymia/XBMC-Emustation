This game kicks some major league ass. It's like Bomberman almost, but with water balloons instead of bombs and Keroppi intead of Bomberman ^^. Oh yeah, and it isn't quite linear, either. You can like go to different rooms and stuff if you want to. So that's cool.

Translation Description:

Six Feet Under did a good job ... yada, yada. But don't take my word for it. Just go get the patch. Now.
