Track &amp; Field II is the sequel to Track &amp; Field created by Konami for the NES in 1988. It still continues the Olympic-themed sports events, but adds more realism by choosing a country for the player to represent. The series boasted 15 sporting events, with two of them available as bonus stages between rounds of the "Olympic" mode. It is based on the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, hence the introduction of Taekwondo (a Korean martial art) as one of the events.
