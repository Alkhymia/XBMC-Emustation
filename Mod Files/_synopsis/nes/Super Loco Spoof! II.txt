Super Loco Spoof! 2 is the sequel to last year's SMB hack called Super Loco Spoof! This hack was given to me by Rockman incase I wanted to finish it, this is the hack that got me motivated to ROM Hack again. Please read the readme for more information in the zip file.

Thank you for playing the hack. :)
