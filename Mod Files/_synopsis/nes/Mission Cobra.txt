Searing gunfire inflicts heavy damage on both sides as you slice into a murderous squadron of enemy fighter jets. As the commander of a fast and powerful helicopter, you must face an intense struggle against a pair of patrolling choppers before you are allowed to turbo-boost through enemy defenses to reach the motherships. Only with fast reaction and uncanny accuracy can you defeat the motherships which launch a seemingly endless arsenal of weapons.
