Now that Ghosts have invaded the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario is gone, Luigi in on an adventure to save the Mushroom Kingdom from his greatest fear. He'll also encounter zombies, Panser plants and the Phantom who makes Luigi's life miserable. You'll also find that this hack has two endings, one good and one real. And the music has a sad creppy tone to it. So if your craving for a challenge, help Luigi end this nightmare?



This hack to me is very special to me cause it was insipred by Mikachu's Mario Panic 4. Luigi from SMAS SMB is the star. And this hack is yup...challenging, don't go insane &amp; don't complain about the difficulty of the hack, it'll make you strong if you finish it. ;) 

Game A and Game B? WTF?

There's two versions of Luigi's Chronicles, Game A is the regular hack that plays like Super Mario Bros. Game B makes the enemies act different and you get a new power up, there are two endings in this hack. The Good ending and the Real ending. Enjoy Luigi's Chronicles everyone.
