_________________________
This is a Nes miniature golf simulator. It seems to follow imaginary physics. I wish I had something more in-depth to say ... but that pretty much sums this game up.

Translation Description:

The only thing that was in Japanese was the title screen, so a new title screen was hacked in and... well, that's it. Enjoy your new English game kids.
