This is one of Tengen's few licensed games, before they cracked Nintendo's protection and made games as they wished.

Pac-Man is a primal video game that is all about trade-offs. Every possible move has good and bad qualities. Eat pellets to complete the level, but you slow down and a ghost might catch you. Grab a power pellet and eat ghosts, you are not completing the level and the ghosts could turn while you are hunting them. Greedy for the fruit? Pac-Man has you making decisions at every turn in less than a second. Wakka-wakka indeed.

Directions:

Navigate Pac-Man through the maze and eat all the pellets. Avoid the ghosts moving about the maze unless you've eaten a big Power Pellet that turns them dark blue. Grab the fruit that appears occasionally for extra points.

Controls:

A Button: Nothing

Hints:

Ghost Behavior
Blinkey(Red)-
Blinkey is the most aggressive of the ghosts. He'll follow you around corners and stay on your tail like no other. He speeds up at you eat more pellets.

Pinky(Pink)-
Pinky leads the pack in and out of scatter mode. She's the first to chase you and the first to back away. She runs around corners counter-clockwise(Working with clockwise circling Blinky and Clyde to trap you).

Inky(Blue)-
Unpredictable.

Clyde(Orange)-
Clyde is often aloof from the group. He's the worst at following Pac-Man. Don't waste your time hunting him if you got a power pellet, as his job seems to be distraction.
