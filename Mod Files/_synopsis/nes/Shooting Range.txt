Think you have what it takes to be the fastest gun in the west? How about the ace of outer space? You'll need a quick draw, a steady hand, and a dead eye to prove your stuff in this fast paced test of sharpshooting skill. But remember when all is said and done, in Shooting Range, you're either a hot shot or your not.
