Based on the movie, so the storyline is basically the same. You play as Luke Skywalker, and using your blaster, lightsaber and force power skills, you must journey through Hoth, Echo Base, Dagobah, Bespin and Cloud City. Enemies such as Darth Vader and Boba Fett will appear along the way, while R2, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear to give you tips on enemy weakness. Also keep and eye out for things you won't see in the movie, such as trying to beat Slave 1 (Boba Fett's ship) and fighting Cloud Cars.
