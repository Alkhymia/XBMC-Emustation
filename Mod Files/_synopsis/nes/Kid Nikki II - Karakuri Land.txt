_________________________
Basically, here's your typical side-scroller. You have a really cool weapon which can go in all four directions, and you break bells for nifty power-ups and stuff. Other than that, well, there's really not much else to say about the game. Anyway, despite what some people say about Kid Niki 2, it's a pretty cool game, so give it a try if you're bored or something.

This is a completed English translation including the ending which was broken in previous versions.
