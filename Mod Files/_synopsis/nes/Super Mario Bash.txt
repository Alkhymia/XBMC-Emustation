Super Mario Bash includes all new levels (all 8 worlds) and new graphics. I find most Mario hacks to be too hard (by making them super-hard they get away with only changing world 1?), and not actually fun, like it's supposed to be. So my levels are more like what you'd find in a real Mario game.

BTW, I borrowed some graphics from the Japanese Mario 2, but I think there's a little bit from other hacks as well. It's been 5+ years since I made it so I can't remember for sure, nevertheless find and contact the original authors to ask for permission. Hope it's not a problem.
