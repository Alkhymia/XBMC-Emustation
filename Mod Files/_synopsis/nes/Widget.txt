Widget must stop his evil twin from destroying the planet Earth. Widget was sent to Earth and uses his changing powers to fight enemies.

Overview:

Widget is a platformer, much like Mega Man where you play as an alien who shoots pellets out of a gun. Also like Mega Man, the player can choose which level to play first, after beating the first level, and gains a new weapon (in this case new creatures he can change into) each time he beats a boss.

It is based on the cartoon series Widget the World Watcher, staring a purple alien named Widget who has the unique ability to transform into other versions of himself, including a golem, a cannon, a bird and a speedy mouse. It also had a sequel by the name of Super Widget on the Super NES.
