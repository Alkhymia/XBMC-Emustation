_________________________
This is the true version of Strange Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels.

NOTE: In worlds 3-1 and 6-2, you're going to have to find the vine to find the flagpole, but in 3-1, it's not so hard. In world 6-2 though, it's in the last block that's above the tenth pipe in the level.
