It's only you and an ice hammer as you make your way to the top of the mountain! If you can break through 8 levels of treacherous arctic ice, you'll reach the top of the mountain. But watch out - the Nitpicker, condors and Polar Bears don't want you up there. And they've got a bag of tricks that will block your rise to the top. There are 32 challenging peaks to scale - face them alone or with a friend.

--From the NES Ice Climber instruction manual.

Overview:

Two ice climbers, Nana and Popo have heard of magical vegetables on the mountain tops. So they went off in search of them, while fighting off Yetis, birds, and whatnot.

Directions:

Fight monsters and break blocks with mallets to get to the top, and collect vegetables to gain bonus points. Play with another person for a better playing experience.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use mallet
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Choose One or Two Players

Hints:

Infinite Lives
In level two, if you hit the block that is colored pink, then you will hear a ringing sound and you will have infinite lives.
