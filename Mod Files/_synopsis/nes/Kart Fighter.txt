I remember enjoying the Kart Fighter rom on the net since I first saw it many years prior. The game itself is not too great, if you've played any of the Street Fighter clones on NES then you've played this game.

Something enjoyable about Kart Fighter is that the characters are from Super Mario Bros. If you've played Super Smash Bros. or Super Smash Bros. Melee, you would probably agree with me that Kart Fighter is a close cousin.

I always get a good chuckle our of the graphics. Parts of the game look "ripped" from Nintendo's Super Mario Kart game; other backgrounds look like they were swiped from Little Nemo: Dream Master. The characters themselves...absolutly weird. When Luigi fights, he looks like he is on drugs. Princess Peach is dressed in a short skirt, I guess she's showing off her sexy legs? Some of the other characters look quite humerous as well.
