_________________________
This is a fun little puzzle game. Basically, you are a ghost, and you run around with a rope. Basically, you have to use the rope to encircle blocks that have apples or power ups in the middle. The power ups do many things, the most useful of which is to make the ghost's rope longer so you can encircle more blocks at one time. Couldn't tell you what guy said, "Hm... ropes... ghosts... apples... Let's make a game!" What I can tell you is that guy, whoever and wherever he is, is a genious, because it's fun.
