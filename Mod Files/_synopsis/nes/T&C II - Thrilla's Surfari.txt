T&C Surf Designs II: Thrilla's Surfari is a sequel to the original, Town & Country Surf Designs: Wood & Water Rage for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game system. The game features Thrilla Gorilla, a surfing/skateboarding mascot of the company, Town & Country Surf Designs , on a quest to save his girlfriend who has been kidnapped, as you find out in the opening scenes.

Gameplay involves steering Thrilla around obstacles, over pits and past creatures while collecting coconuts used in the shell game to gain extra lives, bananas to gain extra life, and powerups such as the handstand powerup which grants temporary invulnerability to all manners of danger but pitfalls.
