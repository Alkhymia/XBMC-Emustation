	1) Fixed some typos in the python scripts.
	2) Added support for custom root directories for Emulators and Roms.
	   ( Note: a rescan of all cut files will be needed if you use a custom _roms or _emulator path.
	   The folder structure must be the same but you can place the directory on a different partition now
	   Example: I have mine in F:\XBMC-Emustation files\ and XBMC-Emustation on the E partition. )
	3) Updated the font.xml and all corresponding files.
	4) Redone the _Layouts files layout and structure and how they are processed. Its all done on the fly now.
	5) Slight update to the home.xml when you select an entry it focuses a hidden button so you cant move.
	   ( the script will refocus you to the list if there is no content )
	6) Updated the Customize Home menu.
	7) Added the update batch file, it just prepares the XBMC-Emustation folder for FTP.
	8) Renamed all the python scripts, also updated all xml files that use them.
	9) Python script optimizations.

09/08/2017
	1) Updated the xbe and source to not show the .xpr on the end of the label for Skin.CurrentTheme, so now shows carbon instead of carbon.xpr eg....
	   ( had to update all the xmls that used the stringcompare )
	2) Added logging to the "create cut files.py" script, disabled by default as the auto mode will spam the living hell out of your log file.
