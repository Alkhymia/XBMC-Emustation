	1) Fixed a few types in the scripts
	2) Forgot to update the welcome window ID
	3) Updated the intro script to support multiple extension.
	  ( avi,mp4,wmv,xmv - filename is intro, but this can be changed in the startup.xml)
	4) removed the firstrun script and just use the scan.py instead since I added silent mode to it.
	
	..: added after first commit :..
	5) Added more error handling to the Cut file script and also made it do house cleaning first.
	6) Made the Scan script hide emulators with zero cut files
	7) Script optimisations ( now that I can see the code better lol )
