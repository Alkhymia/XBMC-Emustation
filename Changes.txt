	1) Fixed a few types in the scripts
	2) Forgot to update the welcome window ID
	3) Updated the intro script to support multiple extension.
	  ( avi,mp4,wmv,xmv - filename is intro, but this can be changed in the startup.xml)
	4) removed the firstrun script and just use the scan.py instead since I added silent mode to it.
